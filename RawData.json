For instance, your childhood/education most likely conditioned you to have certain values, which you should not reject simply because they did not (somehow) arise \"directly from you\" (you may still reject them e.g. if they're contradictory). Besides, you will have been conditioned not only to want some things, but also to derive satisfaction from and genuinely value/appreciate these things, thereby making it justified for you to keep pursuing these things.\n\nI suppose one could save your remark by rephrasing it as *\"it's good to evaluate whether what you want will actually be of value to you\"*.

They pretend to want something (e.g. in order to fit in), and end up thinking that they actually want that thing (even though it will bring them no satisfaction).\n2.

This concept goes by many names, but is generally called the theory of Natural Law.  It's been around for a long time, but it was very visibly codified with the creation of the United States of America.  \n\nHowever, Natural law has not always been part of the culture.  Natural Law, and the Culture in support of it tended to advance together, jointly, through the British Common Law system, starting as far back as with the Magna Carte.  Or you can go back even further to something like The Ten Commandments.\n\nIt culminated in the United States, which was the first country to actually be *founded* on the concept of Natural Law, and which had Natural Law embedded in its beginnings (Declaration of Independence) and in its highest authority (The Constitution).  From there, it became part of the culture, and as United States (And British) Culture spread around the world, it became parts of other cultures as well.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence was an appeal to a higher authority.  It said quite openly: *\"We're going to break the law, in service of a higher one.\"*  They were going to break King George's Law (Political Law) in service to the fundamental rights of humans (Natural Law).\n\nThe very first sentence sums this up very well: \n\n&gt;\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\n\nWhat a sentence.  Breaking it down:\n\n&gt;\"We hold these truths to be self-evident\n\nTruths - not opinions, consensus, or decision.  Truths. Things that remain the same regardless of individual or group opinion.  And not things we invented, but self-evident things we revealed, and that anyone can discover if they think long and hard enough.\n\n&gt;that all men are created equal\n\nobvious not equally tall or wealthy or talented, but equal in inherent value and standing in terms of rights, and thus equal before the law.\n\n&gt;that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable Rights,\n\nFor people that believe in God, this is clear cut.  But even for those who don't, they need to recognize the importance of this sentence.  Humans by virtue of their existence and humanity have unalienable rights, granted to them by *some sort of power* greater than that of other humans.  Call it History or Natural Rights or God or whatever, but it is an authority beyond the reach or contravention of mortal men.  If it weren't it would be meaningless.\n\n&gt; that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\n\nNatural law straight-up here.  Nobody wants to be murdered. Nobody wants to be stripped of their freedom.  And while not everybody will be happy, and it's no one else's job to give you happiness, everyone should be free to pursue their own happiness - whatever that means for them.  These things get restricted only in service to maintaining them for others.\n\n\nThe Constitution then further emphasizes and elaborates on all this with the Day 1 DLC *\"Bill of Rights\"*, which is filled with negative rights. Rights people had inherently - not ones *granted* by the government.  All they said was these are natural, inalienable rights, and the government is not allowed to touch them. Congress shall not infringe, Congress shall not prohibit, etc etc.\n\nAnd the culture at the time wasn't 100% there in support of it.  Slavery was still a thing.  A lot of people believed in the supremacy of the crown over individual human rights.  Culture and Law have pushed each other, but more often than not, good natural law was put into place by smart political philosophers, and the culture grew used to the concept over time.\n\nThis is literally the basis of the last major positive step forward in political philosophy, back during the 1600's.  Human rights and limited government power.  Since the founding of the United States, we've gotten incremental improvements that serve to better extend these concepts of rights to all people.

What is physical matter in and of itself, behind the mathematical structure described by physics? This problem, too, seems to lie beyond the traditional methods of science, because all we can observe is what matter does, not what it is in itself\u2014the \u201csoftware\u201d of the universe but not its ultimate \u201chardware.\u201d On the surface, these problems seem entirely separate. But a closer look reveals that they might be deeply connected.\n\n**Problem of Consciousness**\n\n&gt;No matter how precisely we could specify the mechanisms underlying, for example, the perception and recognition of tomatoes, we could still ask: Why is this process accompanied by the subjective experience of red, or any experience at all? Why couldn\u2019t we have just the physical process, but no consciousness?\n\n**Problem of Matter**\n\n&gt;One might wonder how physical particles are, independently of what they do or how they relate to other things. What are physical things like in themselves, or intrinsically? Some have argued that there is nothing more to particles than their relations, but intuition rebels at this claim. For there to be a relation, there must be two things being related. Otherwise, the relation is empty\u2014a show that goes on without performers, or a castle constructed out of thin air. In other words, physical structure must be realized or implemented by some stuff or substance that is itself not purely structural. Otherwise, there would be no clear difference between physical and mere mathematical structure, or between the concrete universe and a mere abstraction.*\n\n*NOTE: A few things I will point out:\n\n1) There is actually a strong philosophical precedent for a metaphysics that takes a structural stance towards reality (structural realism in phil of science, mathematical structuralism in phil of mathematics, etc.). Ladyman and Ross, in their recent work \u201cEvery Thing Must Go,\u201d aim to naturalize metaphysics (trying very hard to go against the idea that metaphysics is everything goes when it is of paramount importance that the scientific enterprise and our best understanding of theoretical physics provide constraints on what theories philosophers construct) and end up providing strong support for a form of realism about the world that aligns with mathematical realism (there seems to be a mathematical edifice/structure to reality in the way that fundamental elements of the world interact and behave). It\u2019s not simply us describing the world in mathematical terms, as this wouldn\u2019t help answer the question of why these mathematical structures seem to be instantiated in physical reality (again, note here that \u201cphysical\u201d is in need of further delineation, especially when our modern understanding of the world has subatomic particles being zero-dimensional point particles with no known substructure, despite having properties like mass, charge, and spin).\n\n2) Many philosophers are loath to depend on (what many consider is an extremely vague notion) \u201cintuition,\u201d so by no means should the idea of something \u201cgoing against intuition\u201d be the ultimate arbiter of whether or not it can be incorporated into a coherent worldview. That being said, many other philosophers would stress that we should have very good reasons before going against \u201ccommon sense realism\u201d and the ontological commitments that follow.\n", "link_id": "t3_64ka1k", "parent_id": "t3_64ka1k"}, {"body": "That's an oversimplification of his position.", "link_id": "t3_63cshp", "parent_id": "t1_dft6ge5"}, {"body": "Yes", "link_id": "t3_67o89y", "parent_id": "t1_dgs0vmo"}, {"body": "This did not summarize the main points at all", "link_id": "t3_683a83", "parent_id": "t1_dgvb1ka"}, {"body": "If we were in a simulation there's no way a simulated reddit would have such an awful search function.", "link_id": "t3_66pdk6", "parent_id": "t3_66pdk6"}, {"body": "So You think not eating cat food is putting on airs", "link_id": "t3_676j0a", "parent_id": "t1_dgoh28r"}, {"body": "But there's no reason why *subjectivity* can't be an intrinsic property of the universe.

While this is significant, full legalization of all aspects of the drug industry solve a number of other very large issues. I'll just list a few here, maybe two and a half.\n\n* It would allow the government to carefully regulate the purity and strength of drugs. No dealers cutting drugs with dangerous chemicals, or lacing it with other drugs. Cocaine is cocaine. Heroin is heroin.\n\n* It would remove a huge amount of incentive to engage in street violence. Violent gangs, of which America has many, are extremely invested in the drug trade. There are a plethora of other activities, sure, but a majority of their profits, and thus a majority of their competition with other gangs, stems from the drug trade. A legal market would remove a great deal, perhaps even most, of illegal drug trade profits, meaning many of those gangs would lose a great deal of their modus operandi.\n\n* Extended from the point above, legalized production would seriously undercut foreign drug industries. Most drugs produced, particularly in South and Central America, come to the United States. Legalizing drugs like marijuana and cocaine in particular, would drastically reduce violence from drug cartels and gangs throughout South and Central America, and since the vast majority of even Old World-produced drugs (like heroin) come through Mexico, all of which would put huge dents in the profits of people like the Sinaloa cartel.\n\nFull legalization would obviously come with a whole host of new problems, like easier access to extremely dangerous drugs and the potential economic repercussions thereof (if heroin became as widely abused as alcohol, we'd be in for some pretty big issues), but overall, it seems to me that full legalization would result in dramatically fewer people suffering than not only our current policy, but also than simple decriminalization of drug use.

The conservative on the other hand says that the predominate CLF is predominant for a reason, and that therefore it should be given special priviliges wrt it's ability to reproduce itself and survive whatever economic conditions arise. In the sense that this represents a positive choice of one CLF over another, choice is allowed. \n\nWith the spread of postmodernism, the liberal tradition became predominant and with it the prohibition to choose a CLF - some people became unmoored in a technological bubble that drastically increased access to entertainment, information and commerce at the cost of (essentially) their psychological health. other people realised that there was to be no further domestic policy of any sort after 9/11 and to stop asking; others still just got killed in several strange wars, that did not resemble the wars we had grown up hearing about in movies and so on (WW2 primarily - the 'normal' war that is extraordinary because of its normalcy). in 25 years in a midwestern industrial town a guy might have gone from supporting his family as a single earner in the mines, to an old man dying of mesothelioma with no healthcare and a son with a weird twitter account. The postmodernism comes in when the guy becomes the but of John Oliver's jokes as the archetypical Trump voter - because everything can be laughed at, everyone is equal; you aren't a miner or a carpenter or a father - you are a global citizen under capital, and for the record buddy, it's CURRENT YEAR and everything you do and believe is wrong. \n\nWith the alt right thing, when you look at it what you find is a lot of them just have no idea where they are on policy - you see Mike Cernovich and others lamenting the syrian strikes because they could have paid towards single-payer health care etc. So you find this 'going inbetween' motion the video talks about, where they will move positions a long distance in a traditional political sense, but really the important part is the effect of the position in the wider context of the perceived culture war between globalists and various forms of nationalists. They enjoy their ability to pick up and drop positions to defend a point without any moral concerns (this is why the default mode of the Alt-right is the troll) and in a sense this is a post-modern sort of combinatorial procedure; but in contrast to the listless 'end-of-historyness' of the 90s, they take a fixed concrete political position to project all their weirdness and wordgames on to.

The concern is that if philosophers are prone to systematic errors in reasoning, then the integrity of philosophy would be threatened. In this paper, I present some of the more famous work in cognitive science that has marshaled this concern. Then I present reasons to think that those with training in philosophy will be less prone to certain systematic errors in reasoning. The suggestion is that if philosophers could be shown to be less prone to such errors, then the worries about the integrity of philosophy could be constrained. Then I present evidence that, according to performance on the CRT (Frederick 2005), those who have benefited from training and selection in philosophy are indeed less prone to one kind of systematic error: irrationally arbitrating between intuitive and reflective responses. Nonetheless, philosophers are not entirely immune to this systematic error, and their proclivity for this error is statistically related to their responses to a variety of philosophical questions.

This way you have a sound method for discerning what you can dependably say is true which remains flexible and open to change in the face of anything that may contradict preconceived truths rather than simply accumulate complementary opinions. However, it's important to acknowledge that not all things can be defined in any dependable sense under this lense.

The philosophy of Epicurus holds that the Gods--Epicurus being a polydeist--, are not concerned with our existence because to be concerned with our existence would negate their happiness in some way. The God's are supremely happy, because they have recognized that happiness is the supreme good to be sought. Thus, there needn't be any reason to fear them.\n\n&gt; 2) How do we reconcile the regrets we may have of doing certain things - or of not doing certain things - due to the finite amount of time that we have?\n\nPresumably by using death as a motivation to act, or being apathetic to its inevitability and not changing habit. The only thing this part of the four-part-cure does is tell us that death isn't something to be feared (notice: not the act of dying, but the state of non-existence, this is very important to your objection) so this objection/question seems more geared for something else.\n\n&gt; 3) At what point do we differentiate between our desire to obtain natural + unnatural needs + unnecessary things and the desire to improve ourselves? For some, it the process of trying to improve ourselves, or obtaining a goal, that brings the greatest pleasure. At what point do we simply become complacent?\n\nEpicurus says that no pleasure is a bad thing in-itself (Principal Doctrines: 8), but that the consequences which the pleasure brings may outweigh the pleasure achieved. Let us take the example of Mike, a young and ambitious lad, who wishes to achieve 2 million dollars to achieve luxurious items. While he may have fun getting there,--I can't imagine the pleasure of this would be too great, given the labor required for this type of money--,whereupon achieving this cash, and subsequently the items, he finds himself burdened by them more than pleasured, and then he has so many things to take care of, and worry about, while he has to sustain these luxurious items. Epicurus, the hedonist he is, would find that the pleasure gained in achieving this money does not out-weigh the other aforesaid pains. Instead, we can aim our desires for natural things which require *effort* to obtain, but aren't unusually hard, such as a long run.\n\n&gt; 4) I think this point actually confirms my point #3.

Moreover, keep reading in Book 5 of The Gay Science (which IIRC was added in the second edition of the text, post TSZ), and you will see that Nietzsche by no means 'laments' the loss of Christianity. \n\n347: \n\n&gt;Believers and their need to believe. - **How much one needs a faith in order to flourish, how much that is \"firm\" and that one does not wish to be shaken because one clings to it, that is a measure of the degree of one's strength (or, to put the point more clearly, of one's weakness).**\n[...]\nFaith is always coveted most and needed most urgently where will is lacking; for will, as the affect of command, is the decisive sign of sovereignty and strength. In other words, the less one knows how to command, the more urgently one covets someone who commands, who commands severely - a god, prince, class, physician, father confessor, dogma, or party conscience. **From this one might perhaps gather that the two world religions, Buddhism and Christianity, may have owed their origin and above all their sudden spread to a tremendous collapse and disease of the will. And that is what actually happened: both religions encountered a situation in which the will had become diseased, giving rise to a demand that had become utterly desperate for some \"thou shalt.\"** Both religions taught fanaticism in ages in which the will had become exhausted, and thus they offered innumerable people some support, a new possibility of willing, some delight in willing. For fanaticism is the only \"strength of the will\" that even the weak and insecure can be brought to attain, being a sort of hypnotism of the whole system of the senses and the intellect for the benefit of an excessive nourishment (hypertrophy) of a single point of view and feeling that henceforth becomes dominant - which the Christian calls his faith. Once a human being reaches the fundamental conviction that he must be commanded, he becomes \"a believer.\" Conversely, **one could conceive of such a pleasure and power of self-determination, such a freedom of the will that the spirit would take leave of all faith and every wish for certainty, being practiced in maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes and possibilities and dancing even near abysses.** Such a spirit would be the free spirit par excellence\n", "link_id": "t3_689tfy", "parent_id": "t1_dgx5es5"}, {"body": "&gt; unintelligible... to us.\n\nNo, it's unintelligible for any conscious being whatsoever.

Even though this is a surface appearance - the reality of both Russia and Jihadist terror is much postmodern and complex than their relative simple loyalty to a notion (Russia uses destabilising and unorthodox military tactics, proxies, cyberwafare. People become Jihadists over twitter etc.); the antagonism is generated because we believe they truly believe and therefore how can it ever be integrated into our panoply of equal viewpoints? the corresponding reality plays out in a much more grey fashion (in my opinion of course!). \n\nPicture the scene on the deck of the titanic - the violinists playing (Jihadist terror(bear with me)), the captain trying to right the ship (Russia), and another person is helping people on to boats (West). Please note i don't mean to draw any parallels between the three and their assignation in the scenario, except the following ones; \n\n1. The violinist is islamic terror only insofar as he is following a transcendant object into the face of death. \n2. Russia is the captain insofar as he is pursuing a strategy that has been somewhat discredited, but it is not necessarily bound for failure\n3. the West is trying to get people on to life boats but suspects there might not be enough to go around and is getting tetchy. \n\nSo in this ridiculous over laboured scenario Post Modernism would say that all three where performing equally valid actions. In the face of death (here a stand in for the impossibility of intersubjective understanding, or capitalism, or global warming...etc). This is where the motive comes from for people to make bizarre statements like 'More people are killed by cars than terrorists, what are you afraid of?'. \n\nMeta modernism might come to the conclusion that the captain and the lifeboat guy are both helping in some concrete sense, and that the violinist isn't helping. Meta modernism might be formulated as; validity of all cultural life forms -except those that are in actual existence incompatible with the continuation of this arrangement. \n\nThe problem being that the intermingling of this logic with far right politics and actual white supremacy has created a weird nexus in the blind spot of every mainstream political movement where anyone with a value ordering that doesn't place the 1%, themselves, and the global populace on the same level of concern ends up eventually. \n\nUltimately I am not hopeful. As you say the togetherness required to establish the normative is being co-opted by various interests. There is an industry that manufactures consensus and consent, and it is the pre-eminent sensation of the times to feel constantly jarred that you are not aligned with the normative. I think more and more people are experiencing this feeling as technology makes reality increasingly hallucinatory. People are losing a grip on themselves (anyone who has ever read a bunch of reports and wikipedia and suddenly gone '... hang on am i a racist now?) and reaching out for anything firm, which at the minute consists of far right politics for some, or a die hard dedication to pop culture fandoms for most. So meta modernism as expressed in the Alt right seems to be itself a defensive movement: we have lurched from crisis to crisis with no map to guide us. The Alt Right membership was raised in a generation of constant crisis and are comfortable with it (see the love of HAPPENINGS, enjoyment of active shooter events).

He went after it \u2026 using the reductio ad absurdum. This form of argument rest on the truth that if the inevitable conclusions from a set of premises are absurd then it follows logically that at least one of the premises that produced them is absurd. Let\u2019s examine, he said, what follows from the premise that anything not composed of mass-energy is unreal or unimportant.\n\n&gt;He used the number zero as a starter. Zero originally a Hindu number, was introduced to the West by Arabs during the Middle Ages and was unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans. How was that? He wondered. Had nature so subtly hidden the zero that all the Greeks and all the Romans \u2014 millions of them \u2014 couldn\u2019t find it? One would normally think that zero is right out there in the open for everyone to see. He showed the absurdity of trying to derive zero from any form of mass-energy, and then asked, rhetorically, if that meant the number zero was \u201cunscientific.\u201d If so, did that mean that digital computers, which function exclusively in terms of ones and zeros, should be limited to just ones for scientific work? No trouble finding the absurdity here.\n\nI mean there is so much wrong in two paragraphs that if hurts.

Laws would not exist if everyone behaved themselves responsibly, and did not abuse their freedom.\n\nBut it's unclear how the proper reaction is therefore to *punish* addicts. Two points here: 1) This argument cuts both ways, if this is the rationale for continued prohibition then upon pain of inconsistency you must also support alcohol prohibition given its well documented damage to society and people's health. If this is the route one wants to go, then we can absolutely debate the merits of the view that certain substances ought to be criminalized because of their perceived harms to society, but it's not a discussion I'm willing to have unless its proponent first bites the bullet and accepts that alcohol and tobacco should also therefore be criminalized. 2) It isn't clear at all that punishment is the way to handle substance use. We can be okay with punishing drug dealers and manufacturers, but in virtue of *what* is an individual who engages in drug use like marijuana *worthy of punishment*? \n\nThere's also the related issue that these conversations aren't likely to go very far if we keep using the umbrella term of \"drugs\". It's a conversation that ought to be had on an individualized basis, given that, for example psychedelics as a class of substances have virtually zero addictive properties, whereas opiates do, and addiction is a consideration that ought to weigh on our moral deliberation, and it'd be unfair to ban non-addictive substances in virtue of having put them in the same class as their addictive counterparts \n\n&gt;The question, for me at least, is whether or not a responsible mature person would even require the use of these substances to control their mood. Let's assume they do, can we note that sometimes responsible 'use' for 'recreation' purposes morphs into irresponsible use for sheer 'pleasure', which results in escapism from the real world or worse yet, addiction. In that light, drugs that carry addictive properties or impair one's judgement are not only unnecessary, they are also dangerous.\n\nSame response to this.

Maybe it started as 00.  Then it was 01.  Then 10.  Then 11.\n\nOr maybe it was 01, but then became 11, and then 00, and finally 11 again.\n\nEither way, it is currently a 11 universe, and while its past may be relevant to someone *outside* of that two-bit universe, within the universe its past is completely irrelevant.  Whether it began as a 00 universe or a 01 universe, both of those two universes were completely erased (in one possible story told by us outsiders) and ultimately replaced with a 11 universe.  So we may as well be talking about different universes altogether, each static, and each existing an eternity from their own perspective, however long and short they may be around from the perspective of an outsider.\n\nNext we could give our four universes a consistent history.\n\nConsider four eight-bit universes ordered in the following way (from our perspective): 00000000, 00000001, 00000110, 00011011.  The entire \"history\" is recorded each step of the way.  Nevertheless, we can still look at these incarnations as four distinct, static universes. \n Whether the last universe is four sequential pairs of bits or one eight-bit unit of information really makes no difference.  Were each of the two-bit pairs conscious and aware of the previous pairs, they might perceive themselves as having changed in an orderly fashion, or else they might start philosophizing about whether a Star Trek teleporter is really just a combo cloning-and-assisted-suicide device.\n\nBut either way, this is not debatable: a 11 universe and its three counterparts are each *certainly* different from a 00011011 universe and each of *its* three counterparts, respectively.  We can be certainly because the first four universes each only contain 2 bits of information, whereas the latter four universes each contain 8 bits of information.  You can't fit any of the latter four universes into the space allotted to the former universes.  And the former four universes do not contain enough information to express the latter four information.  \n\nYou can't even use the first four universes to express the \"final\" eight-bit universe without additional information telling you in what order to stack them.  There is one single correct ordering, and twenty-three possible inaccurate orderings, for twenty-four combinations altogether:\n\n*00011011\n00100111\n00011110\n00101101\n00111001\n00110110\n01001011\n01001110\n01100011\n01101100\n01110010\n01111000\n10000111\n10001101\n10010011\n10011100\n10110001\n10110100\n11000110\n11001001\n11010010\n11011000\n11100001\n11100100\n\n...which means that it takes 5 additional bits of information (11000 being the binary for twenty-four) just to tell us how to order the four 2-bit universes so as to construct the final eight-bit universe... and that universe still isn't even necessarily telling a history in the first place.  It's just eight bits chilling like what up, yo.\n\nSo on the one hand, maybe we are just telling ourselves a story that the past is real, like, really real.  But on the other hand, that still makes our universe way more complex, and the story way more real, than what we could even possibly perceive if the past were totally erased or static-but-distinct (depending on how an outsider tells the story of a sequence of simpler universes.)  If we are in a complex universe that only just arrived, it is *still* a complex universe, whereas a universe which only contains information about the present would be laughably simple in comparison.\n\nWe can *know* we aren't in a two-bit universe.

For instance, consuming psychoactive chemicals, or dying.\n\n&gt; Lewis (1990, 265\u2013266) points out that even if one can be told that the taste of Vegemite somewhat resembles Marmite, unless one has tasted Marmite, this misses the point.\n\nWe're absolute crud at disassembling flavors into parts and describing them to each other. I think we're rather better at emotions, and that's the least conveyable part of parenthood.\n\n&gt; Imagine Sally, who has always thought that having a child would bring her happiness, deciding not to have a child simply because she knows not having one will maximize her utility. For her to choose this way, ignoring her subjective preferences and relying solely on external reasons, seems bizarre.\n\n\"I always thought that having a kid would make me happy, but then I determined that the sum of my goals and values, including my goal of being happy, would be better served by not having a child.\"\n\nThis seems perfectly reasonable. Maybe the person decided that having a child wouldn't be as much of a boost to their happiness after all. Maybe they decided there were plentiful other ways of becoming happy. Maybe they had another goal that didn't involve happiness and decided it was more important than this loss in happiness. Maybe they have a pang of wistfulness when they think of having a kid but have strong evidence that that pang doesn't indicate that they would be happy if they actually had a child.", "link_id": "t3_63lmpv", "parent_id": "t3_63lmpv"}, {"body": "So...

I don't see why the latter raises your sense of indignation and not the former. \n\nAs far as the \"alternative\" such as a UBI, keep dreaming, these are countries with GDP per capita of 5000$ or less. Let me put that to you in real terms. India with a GDP per capita of 2,900 $ has 100,000 cases of leprosy. One $3 dose of antibiotics will cure a mild case, $20 for a more severe one. WHO provides these drugs for free, but the health care infrastructure is not good enough to identify the afflicted and get them the medicine they need. So, more than 100,000 Indians are left horribly disfigured by a disease that costs $3 to cure. That's what it means to have a GDP per capita of $2,900. Your idea of some type of UBI is utterly unworkable in the countries we're talking about. Hands down, strong economic growth that comes from globalization, sweatshops and connect to the world economy has done great things for the world's poor.

You're confusing cause and effect, when you talk about ***Exploitation***, the implicate assumption being sweatshops cause low wages. *Sweatshops do not cause low wages in poor countries; rather, they pay low wages because those countries offer workers so few other alternatives.* You might was well hurl rocks at a hospitals because sick people suffer there. \n\nFor the record, on your alternative of what happens when you close sweatshops. Renowned economist Paul Krugman has something to say: \n*\" In 1993, child workers in Bangladesh were found to be producing clothing for Wal-Mart and Senator Tom Harkin proposed legislation banning imports from countries employing underage workers. The direct result was that Bangladeshi textile factories stopped employing children. But did the children go back to school? Did they return to happy homes?

The first obstacle viewpoint, where finding one thing that makes a goal difficult is sufficient to make you abandon the entire line of reasoning.\n\n&gt; The assumptions behind a superhuman intelligence arising soon are:\n\n&gt; 1) Artificial intelligence is already getting smarter than us, at an exponential rate.\n\nNo, that's *not* one of the assumptions. The most similar assumption is that a sufficiently smart general intelligence can improve its own intelligence, and that that improved intelligence will let it improve itself faster.\n\n&gt; 2) We\u2019ll make AIs into a general purpose intelligence, like our own.\n\nMachine intelligence won't be incredibly similar to human intelligence unless we simply upload human brains somehow, and that probably won't lead to superintelligent AI.\n\n&gt; 3) We can make human intelligence in silicon.\n\nNot human intelligence, and in some format amenable to quick modification and experimentation. It doesn't have to be silicon, but it's likely to have a von Neumann architecture of some sort.\n\n&gt; 4) Intelligence can be expanded without limit.\n\nThe actual assumption is that humans are not the apex of all possible intelligences.\n\n&gt; 5) Once we have exploding superintelligence it can solve most of our problems.\n\nIt can have a huge impact on the world, rather, with solving a wide class of human problems as a major part. Biomedical engineering is one commonly cited field in which we hope a powerful AI would be able to outstrip humans. The ability to manage an economy is another -- humans are demonstrably bad at it, so that should hopefully be one of the more achievable goals.\n\nArt is an area where we don't care, for the most part, whether a superhuman AI is any good. We don't necessarily value a deep understanding of human emotions, but we do, for safety's sake, need an AI to be able to predict whether humans would approve of a particular decision. Emotion understanding may be instrumental in that calculation.\n\n&gt; Intelligence is not a single dimension, so \u201csmarter than humans\u201d is a meaningless concept.\n\nSize is not a single dimension -- there's length and breadth and width -- so \"larger than a breadbox\" is a meaningless concept. Except we can convert a multidimensional vector into one scalar and get a lossy measurement of size.\n\nWe can develop benchmarks of what we want a particular AI to do, and we can observe that these benchmarks outstrip human capabilities rather strongly.\n\n&gt; Humans do not have general purpose minds, and neither will AIs.\n\n\"At least as general purpose as a human\" is the goal in that case.\n\nWe have general purpose learning algorithms already. Humans have special-purpose segments of our brains because they evolved first, or because human general cognition is slow.\n\n&gt; Emulation of human thinking in other media will be constrained by cost.\n\nIt's probably going to be expensive, yes. You aren't going to run an AI capable of administering the whole planet and curing cancer in an afternoon, all on your smartphone.\n\n&gt; Dimensions of intelligence are not infinite.\n\nThe salient question is whether humans are anywhere near the apex.\n\n&gt; Intelligences are only one factor in progress.\n\n[Should be \"types of intelligence\". \"Intelligences\" refers to intelligent beings.]\n\nIntelligence is an important factor.\n\n&gt; At one end is the low intelligence of, say, a small animal; at the other end is the high intelligence, of, say, a genius\n\nEven in those lossy single-dimension scales, humans aren't near the apex. We're just the apex of what's been observed to date.\n\n&gt; A more accurate chart of the natural evolution of species is a disk radiating outward\n\nThis is more accurate because it implies differentiation instead of progress to humans. It's wildly inaccurate in that species diverge on more than two dimensions, the differentiation is not uniform, the vector space of evolution is only sparsely filled, and animals are not really the midpoint between fungi and plants.\n\nHumans commonly convert large vectorspaces into one or two dimensions for ergonomics, not for accuracy.\n\n&gt; That also means that very big, complex artificial intelligences run on dry silicon will produce big, complex, unhuman-like minds.\n\nHuman brains are big and complex. But yes, we are aiming for unhuman-like minds.\n\n&gt; After all, making a human is something we can do in nine months.\n\nMaking a human from first principles is not something we can do in nine months. We were handed infrastructure purpose-built for creating new humans.\n\n&gt; At the core of the notion of a superhuman intelligence\u200a\u2014\u200aparticularly the view that this intelligence will keep improving itself\u200a\u2014\u200ais the essential belief that intelligence has an infinite scale. I find no evidence for this.\n\nAgain, a scale that extends well beyond humans, not an infinite scale. We've calculated energy costs for computations, and we don't have infinite energy. We've calculated maximum theoretical data density, which is not infinite, and we do not have infinite space.\n\n&gt; Setting aside the recurring problem of a single dimension, what evidence do we have that the limit is not us? Why can\u2019t we be at the maximum? Or maybe the limits are only a short distance away from us?\n\nBecause we have a lot of experience with computers and a lot of theoretical understanding of them. We can imagine an AI given a mass the size of the moon built in solid computing substrate. For tasks that are parallelizable, which includes quite a lot, that should be much better at thinking than something limited to a couple pounds of matter.\n\nBecause we know a bit about how brains work. Brains are hugely parallel computers that have a clock speed around 200Hz. We've built computers that can go at 12GHz, a full sixty million times faster, and we have some experience making computers that are parallel.\n\n&gt; A much better way to think about this is to see our intelligence as one of a million types of possible intelligences.\n\nWhich is comfortable because you can't compare different types of intelligence. But you can compare outcomes when those outcomes are determined by cognitive abilities.\n\n&gt; I sketched out some of that variety of minds that were superior to us in some way. Here is an incomplete list:\n\nA bunch of text presented as an image. Terrible for accessibility.\n\nA lot of that was about specific capabilities or implementation details that have little to do with cognitive ability. Most of the intelligences described were vastly inferior to humans in cognitive ability.\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s take curing cancer or prolonging longevity. These are problems that thinking alone cannot solve.\n\nWe use physical simulations in some of these areas. A superhuman intelligence can potentially make faster physical simulations, allowing for faster iteration.\n\nHumans use evidence to guide their research. One sort of superhuman intelligence involves coming to conclusions with less evidence without sacrificing accuracy. A superhuman AI might not require as many experiments to develop the requisite technologies.\n\nHumans have to execute experiments. A superhuman AI that is good at parallelism can manage many experiments at once.\n\nHuman inattention leads to experiments reaching false conclusions. We would not design boredom as an explicit aspect of a superhuman AI -- or if we did, a superhuman AI would be better able to automate experiments.\n\nHumans need a lot of environmental support. This makes it harder to avoid sample contamination -- humans won't survive as well if their lab areas are frequently flooded with sulfuric acid. A superhuman AI will use machines to do lab work and can design machines that will survive harsh decontamination.\n\nAnd most importantly, if we create an AI administrator over the whole planet, it can allocate the required resources to the problem. It can engage in large-scale engineering and science projects that humans aren't willing to spend resources on. It can develop better resource acquisition systems and more efficient manufacturing processes so that hopefully we don't need to give up much to gain those improvements.\n\nThese are the sorts of advances we hope to get, and many of them are from improved thinking abilities.

Use Reason to create the greatest Good for you and those around you. Common ideas for example are not letting external forces affecting your well-being, and accepting \"pleasures\" as ephemeral; this is the same for Epicureans. Something quoted by Seneca from Epicurus, \"If you wish to make Pythocles wealthy, don't give him more money; rather, reduce his desires.\"\n\n- Epicureanism: basically the same as Stoicism, except the greatest Good comes from personal happiness rather than duty to the happiness of those around you; of course even this is an over-generalization in that Epicureans were not selfish to the extent of placing their happiness at the expense of others. Epicureans put less emphasis on enduring suffering with tranquility (as the Stoics do), but to be content regardless of the situation. In this way, people misinterpret Epicureans as indulgent and hedonistic (in the modern sense), but that is not the case.

They are not saying the universe is \"like\" a computer, rather they are saying the world is computational in nature, and computation is substrate-agnotic.  \n\n\n&gt;And even a simulation would be doomed, computers are not immortal\n\nThey don't have to be.    They can just offer vastly longer subjective timescales than we might have otherwise.

You can try and blunder ahead on your own limited knowledge and may still end up producing a car heuristically that (even if poorly) works. Similarly, you could have no knowledge whatsoever of *how* a car works but with good enough memory you could assemble one from its components. Then there's the way you suggest which would involve exhaustively studying the physical properties and interactions of all the parts. Obviously in this case building a functional car should be trivial. \n\nAll three of these situations bear relevance to humanity's attempted progress toward AI. The first is most familiar, we don't completely understand all the relevant structure or processes but we have a rough idea and tinker our way toward a conscious mind. There is no fundamental reason this approach should fail, if you end up having correctly assembled the necessary components (or at least, in a way that works) to generate consciousness. If you missed some essential process, then ya it might appear conscious externally but of course we cannot directly observe the subjective experience of lack thereof to be sure. So while we may not succeed in this manner, there is no inherent flaw that means we are destined to fail.\n\nNext in the analogy we imagine that the inner workings of the brain, on a functional level, are not understood. We have perfectly scanned the brain (in this hypothetical) revealing all its structure and processes. So now just like the guy with the great memory of a car he saw but no automotive knowledge, if we assembled a brain according to this blueprint it should be perfectly functional. This situation is not so interesting to your question both because it's pretty obvious and because this lack of conceptual understanding prevents abstracting this set of blueprints and applying it to a different platform.\n\nFinally, the equivalent to the third situation: We can take apart brains, we can scan them, we can try to observe their structure and the chemical/physical properties at work and eventually everything about human cognition is understood. We apply this abstract framework to emulate consciousness on a computer or specially designed hardware, and are of course successful.\n\nTo me, the first situation is most likely to occur, and it certainly will be very difficult if not impossible to determine if our creation is \"truly conscious\" or just appears to be from our external perspective.\n", "link_id": "t3_64ka1k", "parent_id": "t1_dg3axwj"}, {"body": "I think many or most factory farmed animals have lives which are net negative. \n\nHowever, even if that weren't the case, the animals we raise for food are social animals and as such are distressed by separation, and often appear to grieve.

The general statement \"correct beliefs are crucial for successful outcomes\" should be considered true, with a few caveats, rather than \"false because there's a counterexample\".\n\nWe often conduct ourselves by *planning* a course of action and then executing it. Planning consists in making predictions about the outcomes of our actions (an outcome being a descriptive \"state of the world\"); we are then able to pick the actions leading to the most favourable outcome (having evaluated the outcomes). Wrong beliefs defeat the purpose of planning: except in extraordinary cases (e.g. two different wrong beliefs cancel out), wrong beliefs yield wrong predictions, and so lead to selecting a suboptimal course of action.\n\nObviously, it is also true that we are not always capable of picking the optimal course of action, even if we consciously recognize it (e.g. due to laziness or fear).

Meaning that there is a general consensus regarding the treatment someone is entitled to by virtue of being human. We can appeal to this general notion, that is inscribed in law to varying degrees, in order to struggle against those who violate those standards of treatment by creating a dissenus (Ranciere's concept) in society.

As such, human rights should only be utilized by the victims themselves in pursuit of a politcal goal.

For pharma companies and insurers, there is a strongly vested interest in convincing primary care physicians that most mental illness can be treated with medication by a non-specialist.\n\nBiologicalism for patients is a way of saying \"it isn't me\". Patients are worried about their jobs and their reputation. A bottle of pills is a lot easier to conceal than leaving work every week to see a therapist. Treating mental illness as biological-only gets rid of the temptation to think hard about negative family dynamics that might have created the condition. It allows you to compartmentalize your illness- which of course is part of what probably created the illness in the first place.\n\nThe non-genetic causes of mental illness are taboo, particular in America. Abuse, neglect, trauma and fucked up family dynamics are much more common than anyone wants to admit, but these patterns are often strongly tied to conventional views of the \"right\" way to raise children, religion, or socio-economic realities, and are hard to correct. I know hitting kids as a form of discipline is rampant in my community, and that it's marketed not only through churches but also through a broader culture of 'toughness' and 'respect' that treats anyone who dares to say a word against it as soft and unrealistic. Two working parents can't provide the same level of care as full-time parents, resulting in self-raising kids and emotional neglect, but few families can afford to do it any other way. Work-life balance and expectations of workers are insane in a lot of places, particularly where jobs are few and employment is precarious.\n\nTherapy still has a strong stigma to many people as 'complaining' or 'brainwashing' because of distrust of the psychiatric field- a field that often has the unpleasant job of pointing out the shortcomings of families and other respected institutions.

Everything is eventually proven wrong and replaced by some evolved form of knowledge and this is only relevant to living human beings that would use that knowledge.\n\nI disagree with this claim. For a few reasons, namely:\n\n(1) The position of scientific realism stipulates that the reason science is successful is because of a correspondence theory of truth relating to the world: that is, the reason you and I have a similar observation of the stars on a clear night sky is because there actually are stars out there in the external world, and their mind-independent existence is the source of the observation that is common to you and I.\n\n(2) The no-miracles argument states that given the mind-independent existence of these objects, the stars, our current and best scientific theories are successful because they (the theories) *pick out* the properties that things such as stars *actually* have.\n\n(3) If our best theories were false, or at least not approximately true, then we would need to attribute the success of science to a miracle. Therefore, we have a choice: we can say that science is successful because of some miracle (the odds would be astronomical), or we can attribute the success of science to the fact that science describes the world either as it is actually like, independently of our minds, or it has latched onto its structure in an approximate way.\n\nThough there are several objections given to this account by contemporary philosophers of science such as Van Fraassen, Lauden, Cartwright and others, in its whole, philosophers agree that the reason for science being successful is because it accurately describes the structure of the universe.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude, that some knowledge will not be proven false: because whatever this knowledge is, it corresponds to the world and the actual state of affairs.\n\nEdit: Fixed typos.", "link_id": "t3_66pdk6", "parent_id": "t1_dgka581"}, {"body": "I'm sorry you had that experience; we should expect more from teachers of philosophy.", "link_id": "t3_631k6r", "parent_id": "t1_dfqqh9a"}, {"body": "&gt;  The need to believe that the universe we exist in was created and guided by some higher power.\n\nI don't think a simulation requires that.

If you accept that simulated universes *can* exist, it is (thought to be) unlikely that such a program would only be run once, or with a single set of parameters.

In a way, metamodernism actually kind of assumes postmodernism is \"right\" in the sense that its points aren't something we can write off. While postmodernism is a really vague, broad term, the sort of thinkers and ideas most people mean when they talk about \"postmodernism\" are people like Foucault and Derrida, who examined (and criticized) the previously unquestioned background assumptions of the worldview that had been built up since the enlightenment. This is where the sort of strawman/flanderized idea of postmodernism as relativism turned up to eleven comes from; postmodernism called into question the enlightenment/modernity's views on reason/rationality, civilization, and so on. The problem with postmodernism wasn't that these interrogations/criticisms were unfounded, but that they aren't really a good stopping point; it's not exactly fair to conflate the idea that the way we construct and evaluate meaning is deeply flawed with the idea that there is no meaning, but it's not *entirely* unfair, either, if you don't go somewhere with the idea. (Incidentally, postmodernism didn't stop there and went a lot of places with the idea, but most of its critics find it easier to ignore this since it doesn't mesh with their \"nihilistic relativism\" gloss.) Metamodernism is basically concerned with one particular approach to finding a coherent way to construct meaning (or justify the meanings we've constructed) in light of the very real problems postmodernism pointed out. A very simple and thus pretty reductive way to put it would be that while it's definitely an effort to move away from postmodernism, it's not trying to move away because postmodernism *was* wrong, it's trying to move away by making it so that postmodernism *is no longer* correct. It wants meaningfulness (and particularly oldschool modernist/enlightenment meaningfulness) to stick around, but understands that it has to change to survive.

Computation is thought to be a fundamental aspect of reality.   Nested simulations have been considered, and thought to be entirely possible.\n\n&gt;Regarding 1, one has to wonder what the economic incentives are to create universes that are just as boring as the original.\n\nNothing in Bostrom's argument speculates on motives or how exciting the \"real\" world is.   We don't know the cost of computing our world from their standpoint.     Our subjective timeline could be running in a higher-dimensional reality on their equivalent of a Rasberry Pi for all we know.    As Greg Egan explored in Permutation City and other stories, if consciousness is computational, then it running at a lower clock-speed than the outside world wouldn't affect the subjective experience for those in the simulated world.    It doesn't matter if we're running slowly, or that our world is paused for a while, etc.   For us there would be no practical difference.    \n\n&gt;What would their purpose be?\n\nNow we're going from \"is it possible\" to \"we can't think of a reason to do so.\"    It could be a genetic algorithm or other stochastic program churning through parameters looking to optimize for something unrelated to us.    This isn't posited as the Truman Show on a planetary scale, where we are part of a TV show or something.   \n\n\n&gt;perfect simulation of even a small fraction of a universe like ours is outrageously expensive.\n\nAnd we don't need perfection.   As has been discussed elsewhere, models routinely use simplification, approximation, and compute details on the fly.   \n\n&gt;The problem is, cutting corners reduces capabilities. If you approximate the ocean by its statistics, life won't evolve in it, that's for sure\n\nHow do you know that for sure?   Seals don't know water down to the quantum level.    And complex behavior and patterns can percolate up from very simple rules.    Even Conway's Game of Life is Turing complete.     \n\n&gt;If you avoid simulating things that aren't seen, machines and computers will shut down when you turn your back to them.\n\nYou don't have to render them visually, but the logic of the program can be handed off to a sub-shell.    It still doesn't need to track every atom in the universe just to finish downloading the file you started before you got in the shower.  \n\n&gt; simulations are unlikely to support sub-simulations: it's the most expensive operation you can think of and the first thing simulators will sacrifice. \n\nI don't agree with your reasoning.   We have no idea how heavy of a burden our world would be to compute to a convincing degree, and we have no idea how easy it would be to offload our own programs to a sub-process.    We could be talking about Matrioshka-brain levels of computers for all we know.    \n\n&gt;you can achieve a higher density of life outside of a simulation than within one\n\n*Can*, yes.    But we're talking specifically about conscious observers, not just life in the broader sense.      If a technological civilization starts with simulations, they could run any number of them.     No one is saying we *can't* be in a \"real\" universe.   The argument is that it is reasonable to infer, from the observer selection effect, that you're in a simulated one, based on his premises.

To some degree, reading a book which heightens your basic critical thinking and logic skill is good; being able to spot ad hominems, realizing if something is committing a naturalistic fallacy, being able to quickly identify the thesis/topic of which the interlocutor is attempting to argue for and delineating their argument into concise premises, being able to identify whether their argument is inductive, deductive or abductive and evaluating their cogency/soundness and being able to give an appropriate response to it and so on. \n\nTo accomplish what I have spoken above, a logic book or critical thinking book is perhaps helpful, of which I'm sure people will begin to list books of their liking during the life of this thread/post, which will probably all be good. \n\nHowever, (I'm not sure of what your intent is) there is a chance that none of the books that will be listed will quite deliver what you wish. For example, if someone lists The Logic Book (so that you will learn all there is to logic), this may take you about an year, or even 5 years, to learn and master, at the end of which you will learn things like Godel's completeness/incompleteness theorem. Now, (assuming you were able to slave through the drudgery, an amazing feat to say the least) does this entail that \n\n&gt; [your] decision making and logical thinking in both my personal life as well as in the business setting\n\nwill improve? Not necessarily. \n\nThese involve values, beliefs and ethics. \n\nSo in this thread you may also get another school/category of books; books involving 'view of life' such as books with regards to existentialism, socialpolitical philosophy, morality (suffering, animal cruelty, racial equality, etc.)\n\nThus, I expect, with your vague request to ask for books to read to make you a ... 'better' person... you will be bombarded by every philosophy book since people at different stages in self-development will post what they believe delivered the most impact in shaping who they are today. \n\n-----\n\nHave you taken any philosophy / critical thinking classes?\n\nWhat do you mean by \"better decision\"? \n\nIf this simply means coherent, consistent, logical, rational, then it seems like improving logic is, straightforwardly, the right choice.\n\nHowever, are you saying \"decision that leads to most happiness\"? or is it \"decision that leads to most efficiency?\" or is it \"decision that leads to finding out what happiness is\" \n\nAs someone who goes through development as a human being, from child to adult to enlightened, what we read changes. \n\nI went from learning about the science (biology, math, physics and chemistry), to basic philosophy (ethics, metaphysics, logic, etc.), but then realized that none of that really is helpful in finding out what happiness is and thus I started to read a lot about Buddhism, Taoism and Shinto. Then I wanted to see how we, as human race, have attempted to reach happiness (now that I had a better grasp of what 'happiness' and 'contentment' was from Eastern Philosophy) and so I'm interested in learning about sociology and government (capitalism, democracy, socialism, communism, etc.)\n\n\n\n-----\n\nanyways. Given how vague the question is, I can't give a book that I would say \"if you read this, you will become a better person\" and the reason is the following. Most books are, to be blatant, difficult and long. If I say \"you should read \"Essay concerning human understanding by Locke\" would you read both volumes? Are you willing to dedicate 3-5 years to read it and understand it? \n\nRecommended books are recommended because it has an impact.\n\nThey usually have an impact because it is very revealing about the deep and complex nature of something we struggle with.\n \nIf they are deep and complex, they are, usually and naturally, difficult to decipher. \n\nFurthermore, if you don't have a better understanding of the work, it will do very little for you relative to the amount of work you  put into it.\n\n\n\nIf anything, i'd suggest things like \"The School of Life\" on YouTube. They have a lot of 3-15 minute videos that reveal a lot about subjects with respect to life. Of which you can then choose what you are ready for; what you are currently interested or inquisitive about.\n\nAlso \"Crash Course Philosophy\" on YouTube will also reveal to you things you may be currently interested in, of which you can start finding books on it on your own.\n\n\n", "link_id": "t3_65m73j", "parent_id": "t3_65m73j"}, {"body": "I was having similar thoughts the other day when I was sitting down with a financial advisor planning for my retirement which is 30 years away.

Approximations don't need to be perfect, just good enough.\n\n&gt; This has to be predicated upon the assumption that we, as reasonably intelligent beings, are at the center of the simulation\n\nNo, not really.

If a velociraptor looked behind a rock, the simulation would fill in the detail as needed.\n\n&gt;There seem to be too many unknown assumptions required for simulation theory to be seriously considered.\n\nThe list of assumptions is pretty short.

If modern day video games where rendered like they were years ago it would take too much processing power to run the games we do today. They got past this by rendering them using a fractal generating engine. This allows them to render more in depth landscapes and have better physics and dynamic lighting with less computing power. That still isn't enough though they took a page from nature as I know it and **only render what you are currently looking at. Everything else you don't see in the game is in a state of probability**. This allows the high end graphics and physics in today's video games to be playable with our current level of computing power.\n\nWe aren't speculating about what might work in the future.   These methods are already used *now* in simulated worlds, just not to the degree needed for this thought exercise.  The only question is whether a being could be conscious from inside a simulation.    That's a philosophical question, and I doubt we'll be able to answer it.

I think therefore I am. My ability to perceive comes before there is anything to perceive; it is the one thing I know is real for sure. As a physicist, I would therefore like to have some physical explanation of this phenomenon.\n\nNext was to observe that my consciousness is directly tied to the processes of matter in my body, yet the matter in my body is identical to the matter making up the food I eat, the rocks in the ground, and the energy stored in quark-gluon bonds that can be released and transmuted into matter. My body was built from unthinking matter, driven into motion by the release of energy stored in chemical bonds.\n\nSo, consciousness is a fundamental part of the universe, somehow inextricably linked to matter and energy, yet with no evidence that there is some fundamental force linking consciousness to, for example, the electroweak field in the normal way with particles and couplings. All the mass in our bodies is accounted for in the masses of the particles which make them up.\n\nYou can imagine at this point some dualist plane dividing consciousness from matter, where the ineffable realm of consciousness lives in some mirror of the physical world, tracking its motion, and hopefully you will discard the notion as being wildly impractical. After discarding this dualist plane, you realize that you never needed it; consciousness, matter, and energy can all be one and the same thing.\n\nIf consciousness, energy, space, matter, and time are all inextricably linked, then you realize that your consciousness is not a separate entity from the rest of the universe, any more than the electrons in a chair are somehow separate from the rest of the universe outside the chair. At the most fundamental level, there is no chair, there is no 'you', except as a useful abstraction for higher-order structures of matter and consciousness such as your brain and your butt. We are all, quite literally, one.\n\n\nA lot of people I've seen react to thoughts like those presented in the OP take a strange 'physicalist' or 'materialist' approach to the question, one I can't wrap my head around. They say, loosely, that consciousness doesn't need to be a fundamental property of the universe; it is enough to say that certain types of complex interactions in matter give 'rise' to consciousness. To me, this is completely unsatisfying. Consciousness is so real, so fundamental, that you can't explain it to me as an emergent property.

After all the universe around us is measurable, predictable, and has hard laws we must obey, what further characteristics would 'reality' have that our simulation does not? What would actually make the true 'reality' more real? \n\nAfter all, say this universe is 'real', we would still be brains in a vat (and we are!) because that's what a brain is, a processing system locked inside a biological casing (our body). Our brain/consciousness isn't actually floating through the universe interacting with things, it's having all of it's sensory information relayed to it and constructed into a model of the external world. This is sort of an expansion on, 'I think therefore I am'.\n\nI also like what Bertrand Russel says, which is simply that, 'it's not likely, therefore you can discard it'. Assuming this is not reality raises a host of unanswered questions like, what are the motives of the simulator? Do they not necessarily have to exist in an equally or more complex reality than our own to simulate all of this? But really, I think Chalmers stance is all you need. This is real, because by the definition of the world 'real' it is real to me.\n\nEDIT: In case anyone actually reads this, I have another point based on what Hilary Putnam says in his argument - the 'meaning based' or 'semantics' approach.

LSD is considered among the most powerful psychological drugs, by legitimate investigators.  \n\n'Primal Scream' therapy was about this time, a continuation of *Catharsis* and the idea that one's own thinking can release a set of demons, profoundly changing one's mental state and emotional equilibrium.  On an interesting note, *Dianetics* makes use of this idea and is the foundation of Scientology.  \n\nThis wound in with the introduction of Eastern thought into Western culture and mind science, and also includes Transcendental Meditation, sensory deprivation, still-disconnected victims of MKUltra, and a host of experimental ideas.  Each one had it's time in the spotlight then faded back into a less-significant tool or method in mind exploration, psychology, and psychiatry.  \n\nIn no way does behavior appear to have much to do with schizophrenia, although clearly behavior has an impact of how the disease manifests.  It is a physical, medical condition and now firmly in the realm of Psychiatry.  It's not an actual clear delineation, but there's no question this is a physical illness, not a metaphysical one.  \n\nThings weren't as clear in 1974.  \n\nYou know this, but I thought I'd add to the conversation here.", "link_id": "t3_67clv9", "parent_id": "t1_dgppw7j"}, {"body": "Neurons have dendrites and axons connecting them to other neurons via synapses, and we know that this sort of arrangement can produce some very complex behavior.

Theology guy here! My thoughts on the article and some of the comments. As a disclaimer, in what is a minorly shameful admission for a theology student at my level, I have not read the novel in question (it comes up a lot in philosophy courses with a theological bent, but I read novels as escapism so I'm not inclined to jump into a book that is basically an informal theology/philosophy text). I will end it with a very real danger that I see with how we talk of agape.\n\nFirst, though, a preamble. What is agape? Agape is the Koine Greek term for self-emptying love or sacrificial love. It is translated into Latin as caritas, which is the highest theological virtue for Aquinas. I mention this not because I'm an Thomistic expert (Lord knows I'm anything but), but because the Latin translation emphasizes a certain character to the word. The English for caritas is charity. Charity, in the Latin or agape-model, is not giving a homeless man change but it is a sort of love. In some respects I feel like charity sums up the word better. Both agape and caritas involve a giving up, but in English the self-emptying of agape tends to be a bit more abstract and theoretical; the charity understand of love emphasizes that the love we see in the New Testament is not abstract but very material -- it's evident in Christ taking up the cross and the early church sharing all goods in common. Agape is not just a posture, it is concrete. \n\nAn issue with the article is agape love is not founded on the potential for good. Agape love is prior to the potential to good in people. Agape love is often traced back to Jesus command to \"love God with all your strength and to love your neighbour as yourself\" (which is from Deuteronomy, IIRC). The way this is often talked about is the command to love our neighbours has nothing to do with our neighbours, it has everything to do with God. \n \n/u/LLLLLink asks if this is a God-like trait and the answer from a theological perspective is yes and no. Yes in that, in the New Testament and in Jesus, this is a trait that is identified with the Triune God. No in that this trait is made available to us thanks to the Spirit. The Son embodies the love, the Spirit guides us to live it out. In traditional theological categories, we would turn to martyrs to talk about this. In accounts of the martyrs throughout history -- up to and including the present -- a recurring aspect is the forgiveness of persecutors during persecutions. In the ancient church, the explanation given for why more people seemed to convert during times of persecution was the character of the martyrs showed they had a better way of life -- praying, forgiving, and singing to their deaths -- which lead to the classic statement that the \"martyrs are the seed of the church.\" The martyrs that forgive those about to kill them are seen as the very embodiment of agape love and used as examples to show that such love is possible. To follow this, I would suggest that modern unconditional love is based off understandings of agape that have been stripped of theological meaning. (Of course, it is a classic Christian conviction that even someone like Hitler must be loved and prayed for; keep in mind the church that affirmed this was under imperial rule and not-infrequent persecutions.)\n\n/u/THEDEALYLAMA has an astute observation about the nature of prejudice. My objection to the article was the early disparagement of habit. Quite a few theologians, those that turn to virtue ethics most obviously, would argue that agape love is habit-formed and habit-forming. Agape love is attained when it is not a conscious decision, but when it a habit. An easy critique of agape love would be the mirror of the author's critique of prejudice; while prejudice is cynical, agape is naive. Is prudence (and thus some level of cynicism?) better than naivety? I'd answer no, but this short article side-steps important elements here, I think (which is fair, given its short length). \n\n/u/skyfishgoo's point is very individualistic and it's actually disappointing that the article didn't touch upon something like this. Interpretations of agape have traditionally been very communal. This is something that's coming back again, because in modernity agape has often had an individualistic understanding. Agape love and accountability to your neighbour are often seen as related, though to what degree has been often an issue of debate. Someone like Aquinas very clearly has an emphasis on accountability to the Church, in his case the Roman Church (or at least in my limited readings of him that's the impression I've gotten). But habits like agape can only be formed in communities that seek to live out agape love. I'm a Mennonite and while we traditionally have not had very much theological justification for our traditional communal lifestyles (we're a group traditionally wary of theology and philosophy), a common conviction has been that you can only be a true Christian in community; thus you can only practice Christian love in community. Someone like Stanley Hauerwas suggests that you can only learn to be good by learning from masters around you; only someone that has the habit of agape can teach you how to be loving. He uses the metaphor of laying brick (being a bricklayer's son): you learn to lay brick by learning all the myriad of skills around the craft and by having a master of the craft teach you when you make mistakes. In such understandings, love can only be taught and formed in communities of people striving to be loving.\n\nNow, an issue I have, and a wariness I tend to have of agape, is that it has often been used to justify victimization. As a Canadian, I have heard horrible stories of Native children in the Indian residential schools being abused and then going to classes to learn that God is love and how agape love is sacrificial. This has often enforced the idea that in the interest of being loving you need to bear such sin without complaint. Agape love as an answer to prejudice is toothless, I feel. Now you can say that Christ's death and the deaths of the martyrs also demonstrate that agape love has no answer to such injustices, but I think the idea of non-violent resistance is also important to agape. It's not summed up in the word, but as Jesus and the apostles demonstrate agape, I also believe that they demonstrate agape does not let injustice have the final word. On a utilitarian level, Paul tells the Roman church that blessing your enemies heaps hot coals upon their head (he attributes this saying to Jesus, making it an interesting Jesus quote because it does not appear in the Gospels!). Agape is not a grin-and-bear it approach to love, but it uses the love to also be a very sharp social critique -- and I will not pretend that the Church ever got this completely right (my Indian residential school example is always close to my heart on such matters as I know too many people that have directly or indirectly suffered through it). \n\nThe stories of the martyrs are great examples of how agape love has been used (intentionally or unintentionally) to convict persecutors (and as a Mennonite, I suggest reading the Martyr's Mirror account of [Dirk Willems](http://www.homecomers.org/mirror/dirk-willems.htm)). Acting with love in situations where hate seems more logical to show just how devoid of love and justice the world truly is. What makes the death of someone who forgives their persecutor so powerful is it demonstrates just how much love the oppressor is missing out on by living the way they do. I can't pretend to offer ways in which to give agape love the tooth needed, but I think the New Testament shows that agape is also firey in all the right ways -- strong feelings rush when injustice is witnessed, it inspires powerful words and condemnations, while building up those disadvantaged. Which is another aspect of agape love -- it builds up even as it says \"look, you have built your life on shakey foundations.\"", "link_id": "t3_68akwg", "parent_id": "t3_68akwg"}, {"body": "I picked it up before having any interest at all in philosophy.

Much of the evil in the world is done not by overtly evil people, and certainly not by mustache-twirling villains,  but by gratuitously optimistic people who have a grand plan for the world.    \n\nI'm in arguments frequently on Reddit with people who want to chuck \"the system\" for some unspecified millenarian new world where money plays no part in politics, no one works just out of economic necessity, and the world is fair.    The degree of optimism there about the plasticity of humanity is staggering, as is the evil that would result if these people managed to take power.    These people need some philosophical pessimism, posthaste.    \n\nWe need enough pessimism to chasten people's millenarian, utopian fantasies, with enough strategic optimism to still work incrementally towards our goals.   So I think these pessimistic writers do bring insights to the table that have important practical benefits.   What I get from them is not a sense of futility, just perspective and proportion.

We could merely be models to whomever they are. What if the characters in GTA V are sentient? What if the guy sweeping on the corner and does not move just accepts that's his existence? Or when we leave the area he actually does something else, but every time we re enter the area he all of a sudden has to sweep and it's just a coincidence he's sweeping every time we see him? Then when the sweeper dies, he dies and what if his universe is on a loop and he just re-lives it, waiting for you to shoot him with an RPG, similar to groundhogs day? What if we are literally monitoring alternate universes on tv and we just don't know or cannot comprehend that because it's in another, 2d dimension? Maybe they, the npcs, are living in a 4d world and we see them in 2d. What if Michael, Frank, and Trevor suffer from what Bill Murray is suffering from in the movie and they just don't care? What if Bill Murray in groundhogs day is being controlled by some kid who thinks he's playing a video game? \n\nSecondly, when we achieve hyperrealistic graphics in video games with perfect facial animations and planet sized maps in games such as GTA. How would you feel shooting an npc in the face point blank in first person, seeing every bit of pain and agony? Idk if I could do it and don't even get me started about doing it in vr. There will be debate about its legality. However, no one will argue they are sentient because that's just crazy, but what if? If you've seen the post lately about horizon zero dawn's field of view and how it disappears behind them, there is still code going on rendering objects and creating story off the field of view, just like our real life. What if it is in the video games as well? What if our programmers can create lives for every individual npc, generating new faces for everyone, and when we look away from them they still exist, they still have lives. We just believe they are npcs we can shoot or run over, not living creatures. What if we attach Super human AI to the npcs? What if our universe is just a \"hyper realistic\" rendering of a video game? Have you played bowling in gta? What if Niko Bellic actually believes someone manufactured that ball, those pins, built the building, and then just can't comprehend the fact that Rockstar actually programmed it? That Rockstar is his god. Maybe an npc in GTAV programmed a video game just like what I'm talking about and started an alternate universe. What if he( the npc) created our universe, an exact replica, and then an npc in \"our\" universe created an exact replica of \"his\" universe, and then it just went on and on! Who is whose god? I read somewhere about how if this simulation theory is true, the original programmer is dead and it's just simulations making simulations...well, there you go. That npc you just shot, he created a universe...our universe. Well, the replica. It's like looking in those infinity mirrors. It just goes on. But you can't look back. \n\nWhat if a serial killer in our universe is being controlled by some programmer in another universe? What if we are being controlled by someone who is playing a game like the sims? \n\nI mean...if the multiverse theory is true, then  there is an unlimited amount of possibilities for forms of life, types of universes, etc...  Spongebob. What if you put on the tv and watch spongebob, and you unknowingly created a universe, or happened to turn it on and you just happened to turn it on during that point of spongebobs life to monitor. How would he know? He's 2d and we are 3D, he wouldn't be able to see us. Watch Carl Sagan's descriptions of dimensions and you'd know what I'm talking about. However, if time was like the movie arrival it is not linear, that means you can turn it on, rewind it, know the future, etc. which is why whenever you see someone in a tv series or video game, you're just tuning into that part of their life at that point of their time. And when you turn it off, it just keeps going, but we don't see it. We only have access to what has already been made by the video game programmers and the tv writers.  \n\nMoving on, when deadpool breaks the 4th wall what if he, in his universe, thinks like me?
