Speakers of Spanish or Japanese would be more likely to say \u201cthe vase broke itself.\u201d Such differences between languages have profound consequences for how their speakers understand events, construct notions of causality and agency, what they remember as eyewitnesses and how much they blame and punish others.\n\n&gt;In studies conducted by Caitlin Fausey at Stanford, speakers of English, Spanish and Japanese watched videos of two people popping balloons, breaking eggs and spilling drinks either intentionally or accidentally. Later everyone got a surprise memory test: For each event, can you remember who did it? She discovered a striking cross-linguistic difference in eyewitness memory. Spanish and Japanese speakers did not remember the agents of accidental events as well as did English speakers. Mind you, they remembered the agents of intentional events (for which their language would mention the agent) just fine.

For instance if I told you someone was murdered in gory detail in your native tongue while you were eating a person from this study might react with more emotion. Maybe due to familiarity with the words and emotions, whereas if you stated the same scene in another language the person knew they would have to translate those words into their native tongue to comprehend what\u2019s being said. That amount of time where the person is comprehending what is being said(even if it\u2019s less than a second) means they are looking at the words themselves more than the emotion behind it.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the person is more or less moral, but that their reaction to the words is diminished when they have to translate. \n\nMy favorite question to ask to non-native speakers is if you think in your native language or  in what you are speaking.

Also, I would avoid using examples of plants and computers for this subject because neither of them are human and for most people the concepts of murder and personhood only apply to humans.\n\nTo me it makes sense that from a *legal* standpoint the period of life before birth should have different rules than life after birth. Miscarriages are unfortunately common and it would not be practical or beneficial to treat those as you would the death of an adult or child. However, from a *moral* standpoint it seems to me that the distinction of when personhood begins is more or less arbitrary. Usually the rationale is tied to a biological event or capability: Conception, brain development, or as someone mentioned in another comment, homeostasis. \n\nIn order to have a productive argument about which of these points is **the** critical point at which a human becomes a person, you first need to have agreement about the definition of terms, which is hard to do with terms such as \"person\", \"life\", or \"consciousness\". If you find someone with whom you agree on the precise definition of those terms, you've probably found someone who already shares your views on abortion.\n\nMy personal view is that both life and moral personhood begin at (or very close to) conception, because that is the first point at which the fetus becomes a biologically distinct entity. It is neither part of the mother's body nor part of the father's body. It is also meaningfully different from an individual egg or sperm cell because (with the necessary biological support) it will grow. The thing it grows into is considered a person, and I do not see good reason for this personhood to come from any of the development milestones along the way (such as the attainment of consciousness).\n\nThat's my position, but there could be any number of logically valid competing ones.

The truth of this, however, does not define the value of the idea - only the scientific testability of it.\n\nSome of the objections that the article gives in this vein are therefore a little silly - one passage mocks a falsifiable scientific theory because a scientist can 'patch it up' when they find evidence that it is false. The article doesn't seem to realise that this isn't called cheating - it's called updating your theory in the face of evidence, and is a cornerstone of what science is.\n\nThe rest of the article, more reasonably, points out that things previously not thought observable have become observable or falsifiable, bringing them into the realm of scientific testing. Sure. This does not change that they *did* have to be observable or falsifiable to be tested scientifically - the principle holds true. It's simply that some people were *wrong* about them. A large number of theoretical physicists and other professionals work every day under the assumption that our technology will keep expanding what it is we can observe.\n\nNone of this actually runs counter to the scientific method or a claim that a theory, to be scientifically testable, must be falsifiable or observable - and none of it really runs counter to how professionals in theoretical fields already operate, many of whom already are theorising currently untestable constructs with the understanding that they could conceivably be testable in the future. They key with these concepts is generally that we have reason to believe that test-ability and observability will come in the near future, given an understanding of our technology and the mechanics of our theories. Indeed, huge leaps are made based on the expectation of an observation happening or not (see: Higgs Boson).\n\nSo, what are we actually saying here?

The unconditionalism inherent in the Judeo-Christian [*edit - see added text below] view of divine forgiveness (except blaspheming the holy spirit, whatever that means - even religious scholars don't agree) has always seemed a little naive, and the notion that a genocidal maniac need only ask for divine grace for forgiveness certainly smacks of \"moral wrongness\" in my opinion. Note that I bring this up because Christians are exhorted to mimic the example of the Lord, thereby transporting this from the realm of philosophical discussion into the every-day.\n\nIn my opinion forgiveness **can** always be freely given, but to say that it **must** always be given (whether at an individual or societal level) is to remove the onus of proof of contriteness from the offender, which in my opinion removes incentive for behavioural change.\n\nEDIT: I certainly should have added two provisos to my comment - I'm at work so I apologise for confusion. I was referring to Protestantism, not general Judeo-Christianity. That one is totally on me. The second note is to provide some nuance to my view - I was not commenting on the generally accepted theology as outlined in religious texts or by religious scholars - my comment were directed towards the practice of forgiveness and how casually it is treated in Protestant circles. I've seen churches take in murderers, child molesters and abusers who had all professed repentance (which is fine), but many of them were simply taken on their word and the notion that \"God's forgiveness is for all\".

Here are some of my thoughts...\n\nAt first glance, I have to wonder if causing offense is, in and of itself, morally blameworthy at all.\n\nOffense is an emotional response - little different from anger or grief or happiness or fear, as far as that goes.  As such, it seems that its mere existence isn't morally relevant at all - rather, its existence is, at least potentially, an indicator of something else that is morally relevant.\n\nIf I kill your dog and cause you grief, I'm not morally blameworthy because I caused you grief.  That's not the point - really, significant though the experience of the emotion might be, it's incidental.  Quite obviously, the act that's morally relevant is killing your dog, and your grief is just an emotional response to that act.\n\nBut that's not satisfying by itself, because \"offense\" is something different from other emotional responses.  In a way, it's both something less and something more.\n\nIt's something less in that it's often a response to something that's not morally relevant in and of itself.  When you feel grief because I killed your dog, there's the clearly morally relevant act of killing your dog at the heart of it, but if you feel offense because I'm wearing a t-shirt with a word on it that offends you, there's really not a morally relevant act at the heart of that.  My t-shirt does no actual, measurable harm to you or to anyone - ALL it's done is triggered an emotional response in you.  That emotional response isn't indicative of something else - it stands alone.  And at some fundamental level, it's just not my problem.  If you don't want to be subject to some particular emotion, then stop cultivating it.\n\nBut at the same time, in another sense, the fact that offense is a bit different from most emotions in that it can be and often is triggered by something that in and of itself is morally irrelevant makes offense something more than other emotions, at least as far as this topic goes.  The thing is that that aspect of offense makes it possible, as you note, for people to act in a particular manner specifically because they know that that will cause offense in someone else, and that specifically because they want that other person or people to have the negative experience of feeling offense.  And that would seem to be a morally blameworthy act.\n\nI tend to think though that that's the only way in which acting in a manner that causes offense is morally blameworthy.  I don't think a case can be made that doing so in ignorance is morally blameworthy, except insofar as one might attempt to make a case that ignorance is in and of itself morally blameworthy, since a person cannot rightly be faulted for doing that which they sincerely do not know to be in any possible way wrong.\n\nAnd even in cases in which one acts in a manner that's destined to cause offense, I still don't believe that it's morally blameworthy unless and until it's done specifically in order to cause offense - or more simply, to make the point better, specifically in order to cause another person to have an unpleasant experience.\n\nIn fact, I tend to think that if a person acts in a way that they know will cause offense but they do so because they believe that their action is morally right, then in some sense, the whole matter shifts.  Then the other party's offense becomes irrelevant *at best*, and it could be argued that the offense is at least edging toward, or indicative of, some moral wrong on the part of the offended party.  At the very least, the offended party then MUST make the case not only that the offending party knew that the act would be seen to be offensive, but that the act is morally wrong in and of itself.  Even the fact that it could be known to be offensive isn't sufficient by itself.\n\nFor instance, I'm certain that a great many people were deeply offended when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on the bus.  I'm just as certain though that virtually all people, most notably including those otherwise most eager to make the case that causing offense is morally blameworthy in and of itself, would argue that she was right to act as she did, in spite of the certainty that it would cause offense, or the fact that it did.  \n\nAnd in fact, I would be willing to bet that most people, and again most notably including many of those otherwise most eager to try to make the case that causing offense is morally blameworthy in and of itself, would, if they were to assign a moral value to the offense caused by her refusal to give up her seat, hold that the person who *felt* the offense - not the person who caused it - was morally wrong.  \n\nAll in all, an intriguingly complicated issue...\n\nI think your conclusion is solid, though I would've likely approached it from a somewhat different angle (as the above likely indicates).  In the long run, I come to roughly the same conclusion - before one attempts to make the case that the fact that one is offended means that one has been wronged, one must first make the case that the offense was intentional, and even more to the point, that it was maliciously intended - not merely that it was known that this action would cause offense, but that causing offense was the exact point.\n\nThere's another aspect to this whole matter though, but while it is, I believe, central to the fact that offense has come to be such a meaningful thing to so many in the current age, it's only peripherally significant to this particular matter.  That's the fact that, for many, offense is actually sought out and cultivated - not merely tolerated, but indulged in - and that specifically because of the role it plays in self-affirmation.  I prove that I'm a virtuous person (by whatever standard) by signaling my offense at (whatever that standard defines as offensive).\n\nBut that's likely fodder for another post (or three), and I think that so long as a distinction is made between acts that are committed with malicious intent to cause offense and acts that are not, it's not particularly relevant.\n\nAnd thanks for the thoughtful and well-argued post.

A working set of shared reflexes is essential to any social species, and ours has co-evolved socially-transmitted rules with selected predispositions. Murderous thugs and the innately uncooperative tend to have poor reproductive efficiency and get knocked on the head when young. The consensus morality is bred into us, and communities that best display it prosper, passing their rules on by conquest, trade and example.\n\nResearch has shown that individuals will take a considerable personal 'hit' in order to punish people who offend against consensus rules. That is because the community carries more of the genes and rules that achieve success than does any one individual.  This is true of humans, but also chimpanzees and pack hunters such as lions and dogs. Experimental economics has gone some way to quantify the relationship between this kind of risk taking and the clarity of the community rules, something known under other conditions as the 'utility function'. \n\nUtility functions vary as between situations and individuals. Even bees show them, varying their foraging behaviour with nectar scarcity and risk. Humans, for who personality types are better determined that they are for bees, have attitudes to risk and the punishment of defection from group norms that vary with the Big Five, but notably with Openness and Neuroticism. Closed, anxious people - the classic safe space snowflake, perhaps - are more worried by challenge to norms that are Open, Stable individuals.

But nonetheless your post was an apt redefinition of The Absurd which seemed to contemporize an issue which already has fairly large reach and impact on life.", "id": "dxfavrs", "parent_id": "t3_8ci2xl"}, {"body": "I have two responses. One is to your prognosis for civilisation, and the second is for your assessment of nihilism.\n\n**Part I: The apocalypse**\n\nI don't think the collapse of civilisation is at all likely. I don't see any significant probability of thermonuclear war given the economic situation between global superpowers and how costly war is compared to economic competition. Also the prevalence of violent conflict has been decreasing.\n\nI also think the human system is antifragile and strengthens in response to shocks.\n\nEnvironmental degradation is a huge problem but we're taking much more significant action than ever before and it has become accepted in the mainstream that we need to rapidly move to address these issues.\n\nThe capitalist world-order and the forces that make it so difficult to take any large-scale, positive action are also under threat. Internationally there is a growing emphasis on social problems of inequality and a rejection of the economic paradigm of austerity and neoliberalism as well as the accompanying economic dogma. The message hasn't coalesced into something coherent quite yet but the direction is clear. The growing popularity of progressive figures such as Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn show the potential.\n\nI don't think we need any scientific miracles to address the environmental problems we have. We need a major shift in economic policy and more investment in primary research, massive increases to public funding and regulation, cutting the powers of corporations. That's not any kind of miracle. It's an easily achievable policy prescription and the only problem is political. But the reason it has seemed so politically impossible to accomplish anything like this over the past thirty years has been the apparent success of neoliberalism and the false consensus around these policies, but the failure of neoliberalism is becoming clear.\n\n**Part 2: Post-Nihilism**\n\nMy basic beef with nihilism is that it masquerades as skepticism but is in fact a highly credulous pessimism. There's a conflation that goes on. To suppose that nothing is true or certain is not at all skeptical; it's taking a statement and applying a truth value to it. \"I believe that nothing is true\" != \"I don't believe that anything is true.\" \n\nSo I see it like, in the absence of certainty, it's not rational to assume that nothing is or can be certain or true. It's just to admit that we don't know if anything is or can be true or certain. \n\nSo the higher form of skepticism is to remain open to the possibility of meaning. There's no reason to call the universe uncaring or meaningless. These are emotive characterisations and there's more neutral language available. The universe is mysterious, uncertain, and in some ways incomprehensible. \n\nThere are fundamental similarities between consciousness and existence, or consciousness and reality. For one we can't say that consciousness does in fact exist, and we don't know what it means to say something exists or not, or that existential questions or metaphysical questions are meaningful. \n\nFor another, consciousness, as experienced, has the apparent nature of being an information system, the capacity to describe, to analyse, perceive and act and to consider. It's a system for the input, output and processing of information. Reality has the same apparent nature; the most popular candidates for a consensus cosmology are the mathematical universe hypothesis and the holographic principle. Both describe the inverse as an information system, variously a mathematical object or a two dimensional space capable of representing or generating higher dimensional spaces within it. \n\nSo my point there is that I don't see a fundamental conflict or disconnect between consciousness and reality, but a huge degree of relatedness. They're both poorly understood; we have no answer to the hard problem of consciousness and also no theory of everything. So I think these two problems are related.\n\nThis doesn't leave me much room for nihilism. I don't see that nothing is true or that there is no meaning. It seems like there may in fact be a fundamental meaning to reality, that it's about information, complexity, order, the generation of novelty and possibly even consciousness. \n\nOf course there's the baseline worst case scenario of the lawless universe but I think these scenarios are indistinguishable. If the universe is lawless then we exist within a locally apparently lawful pocket and so it's always going to look like it has an order to it. I think the same applies to consciousness and transcendent meaning, that we may never be able to tell if there are such things but the two situations, these things either existing or not, are not only hard to tell apart but somehow in-principle indistinguishable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAnyway I get some practical principles out of all this. The meta-ethics comes from a post-nihilist position. I don't believe there are rules, or that there aren't or can't be any rules, or that I have to just make up my own arbitrary meaning or latch onto received ideology. I have to be intellectually cautious and look for what may be true, and remain open to the possibility of meaning. It's not really Pascal's wager, just that this approach seems more skeptical than nihilism itself. If you're going to be a nihilist and say you don't believe anything without evidence, then you can't just settle for assuming things are meaningless but have in fact to struggle to find meaning and attack these questions.\n\nThis is in some ways similar to the idea of revolt or perpetual conflict but I don't see it as being somehow condemned. I think from uncertainty you can get some actual rationally justifiable non-arbitrary meaning.\n\nThere's the Hume thing about not being able to go from a description of the facts to a statement about what ought to be. So the way I get past that is by introducing a basic class of ought-statements, like a unit. These come into being from the fact of the individual's capacity to make decisions. Every moment of consciousness involves making decisions. Even avoiding a decision is making a decision. So it's impossible not to decide things. This introduces automatic ought-statements that we're always making through our actions and our choices.\n\nFrom these I think you can get more specific, practical principles. If you're going to be making decisions, and you reject rules that are imposed upon you without justification, then you're, so far as I can tell, making an implicit ought statement about the importance of rationality and justification. This means you can't just assume that there are no rules. You have to be open to the possibility that your actions and your choices matter. This compels you towards restraint and a careful examination of the facts.\n\nI think from these two principles, one valuing restraint and careful action, and two valuing information, can compel you to lead a good and meaningful life by the standards of most people's intuitive definitions.\n\nI think if you show restraint you're unlikely to go out killing people or selfishly doing whatever you want regardless of how it affects others. I think this takes care of most of the shall-nots.\n\nIf you show consideration and value learning then I think you'll spend your life improving yourself and finding out all that you can, and thinking carefully about it. I also think you'll show a strong interest in opposing viewpoints, and just differing viewpoints and the experiences of other conscious beings as well. I think this should compel you towards compassion and an interest in others, which should build better relationships and meaningful interactions. \n\nThe last thing I think you get is what I think of as a meta-environmentalism. I think as a conscious being interested in rationality you have to value the environment, which kind of means all of nature, everything separate from your own internal world. It's the source of all information, at least all scientific, empirical, measurable information. So you get the directive towards conservationism, but you also I think value the environment and the behaviour of the life-forms in it. This extends to apes and the specific species of homosapiens, and all the absurdity of their beliefs, their behaviours and their societies. I think you stop attacking things like religion or societal rules that seem absurd and instead treasure them as fascinating examples of human behaviour, while also trying as much as you can to reduce the harm, but also exercising restraint and not just blindly running in trying to start revolutions.\n\nAlso I think along with compassion and respecting others' viewpoints you get the need to be compassionate not just towards all suffering beings, not just towards humans, but towards yourself.\n\nSomebody criticised my presentation of these ideas once and said, when I proposed the value of compassion, that it was just my empathic nature compelling me to see things this way, and then me backfilling rationalisations. I think even if you don't feel empathy or compassion, if you really value rationality and information and want to know and understand, you will still try to understand other beings, and understand from their perspective. I think this entails something which in practical terms operates like compassion.\n\nI think the causal theory of knowledge is good for this line of thinking as well. In the same way that you know you know certain things, but you don't know which of the things that you think you know are things you *really* know, I think there are truths that we can intuitively grasp that we can't rationally justify, but which aren't necessarily untrue. It's like Godel as well.

The first is your thesis statement:\n\n&gt; TL;DR: Our post-industrial, late-stage capitalist global civilization is collapsing. How do we reconcile this reality with our inherent will to survive? \n\nNow, let's unpack what you're saying here.  You're essentially laying the blame for this perceived \"collapse\" at the feet of capitalism, saying that it's capitalism's fault that the entire world is ending, basically.  So let's go through each of your claims, and see whether or not capitalism is really to blame.\n\n#The Things You Blame On Capitalism\n\n* Anthropogenic climate change\n\n* Global thermonuclear war\n\n* Deforestation\n\n* Ocean acidification\n\n* Anti-biotic-resistant disease\n\n* Peak oil and resource over-exploitation \n\n* Rising sea levels\n\n*  An ongoing extinction event\n\nNow, of these things, the following are all results of anthropogenic climate change:\n\n* Ocean acidification\n\n* Rising sea levels\n\n*  An ongoing extinction event\n\nSo we'll fold those all under \"anthropogenic climate change,\" and keep you from artificially inflating your list.  So your revised list is as follows:\n\n* Anthropogenic climate change\n\n* Global thermonuclear war\n\n* Deforestation\n\n* Anti-biotic-resistant disease\n\n* Peak oil and resource over-exploitation \n\nSo let's go down the list.\n\n\n\n**Anthropogenic Climate Change**\n\nTo blame this on capitalism is utterly foolish.  There is nothing in the core beliefs of capitalism that necessitates the conditions which have left to anthropogenic climate change.  Anthropogenic climate change is the result of fossil fuels being humanity's most easily accessible and abundant source of energy during a period of our technological development in which we did not have the capability to harness any other form of energy in such a massive quantity to fuel our rapid development and expansion.  Your claim that this is caused by capitalism is simply devoid of any substance.\n\nIndeed, we are already seeing efforts made to combat this within capitalist systems.  Individuals are making the choice, as technology advances to the point where it becomes an option, to use green energy wherever they can instead of fossil fuels.  The advancement of solar, nuclear, and wind energy is leading to more and more widespread adoption of alternative energy sources.  Oil companies are even beginning to invest in it, since they can see where the market is heading.\n\n**Global thermonuclear war**\n\nAgain, this is another situation where your blaming of a problem on capitalism is utterly laughable.  There is no possible way you can claim that thermonuclear war is a capitalist problem.  One of the main causes of the threat of global thermonuclear war in the 20th century was the USSR, which was the most anti-capitalist system in existence.  And today, the biggest threat of nuclear war comes from religious extremists and extreme communist dictators like Kim Jong-Un.  Capitalism has nothing to do with this issue.\n\n**Deforestation**\n\nThis is finally an issue which you could conceivably blame on capitalism.  However, the majority of deforestation occurs in third-world countries when they are trying to clear land to raise livestock on.  This seems less like an issue with capitalism, and more like an issue with technologically developing nations coming online.\n\n**Anti-biotic-resistant disease**\n\nOnce again, this has nothing to do with capitalism.  This is a consequence of our medical technology advancing to a point where we can cure disease, but in a way that inevitably leads to some stronger, resistant diseases surviving those treatments.  It is inconcievable how getting rid of capitalism would fix this issue, especially since no other economic system has developed some magical panacea that somehow fixes this problem.\n\n**Peak oil and resource over-exploitation**\n\nYes, we have reached peak oil.  But with alternative energy sources coming online and increasing in their effectiveness and adoption rate in the private markets, this is quickly becoming less and less of an issue.\n\nSo, the vast majority of your proposed world-ending problems caused by capitalism are, in fact, not caused by capitalism. So the question is, are you ignorant about the world, or are you ignorant about capitalism?\n\nThe first clue we can glean lies in the very phrasing of your TL;DR:\n\n&gt; Our post-industrial, late-stage capitalist global civilization\n\nYou actually believe that the entire globe is capitalist.  Any capitalist would be able to tell you in a heartbeat that that is not exactly true.  This is the definition of capitalism, according to Google:\n\n&gt; an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.\n\nIn our current world, virtually no country is fully capitalist.  In fact, in most of the developed world, almost all trade and a huge percentage of industry (most notably energy and military) are controlled by the government.  So to characterize the world we live in as \"hyper-capitalist\" is simply intellectually dishonest.\n\nThe world, in fact, has been getting less and less capitalist over the past 50 years, and far more collectivist.  We can see this in the social and economic systems implemented in most developed nations, in which the government not only chooses where to redistribute material goods among the population, but actively picks and chooses winners &amp; losers in the economy via bailouts, government funding of certain companies over others, and allowing corporations to bribe their way into the upper eschelons of political power.  There actions and policies are all the antithesis of free-market capitalism, putting another nail in the coffin of your \"everything wrong with the world is because of capitalism\" theory.\n\nNow, let's move on from there to the crux of your \"New Existential Dilemma.\"  You claim that, since the world is for sure going to end because of capitalism (which I've just disproved, but we'll continue for the sake of argument), there are only 3 options:\n\n1. Suicide\n2. Denial of reality\n3. Overthow the captialist system (presumably in favor of communism, socialism, or some other collectivist system)\n\nNow, it's important to note that at this point, you have offered no evidence that the world is facing an existential crisis.  You have simply listed off a bunch of economic &amp; environmental problems, the causes of which you very clearly misunderstand, and declared that one or more of them will surely lead to the world's collapse.  And in the face of this wild allegation, these are the solutions you offer.\n\nNotice anything missing?\n\nIn not one of your proposed options do you *actually suggest addressing the problems you state above.*  It is blatantly obvious what you've done here: you dislike capitalism, so you put together a list of a bunch of things wrong with the world, blamed them on capitalism, and put together a sort of economic Pascal's Wager, where the only \"obvious\" option is the option that you already want everyone to pick, based upon your personal economic belief system.\n\nHowever, your proposed wager suffers from exactly the same problem that Pascal's Wager does: lack of context.  You deliberately misrepresent the argument, artificially limit the number of possible \"solutions,\" and demand that people choose from an incomplete data set built upon a faulty argumentative premise.\n\nYour \"New Existential Crisis\" is not \"New\" at all.  It's the same old lines that have been trotted out by Marx, Trotsky, and hundreds of other collectivist leaders over the course of the 20th century.  \"Everything wrong in the world is because of capitalism!  The only way to fix it is through revolution, where we murder the rich and implememt communism/socialism!\"\n\nYou dress up this tired, old rhetoric with a shiny new coat or alarmist paint:\n\n&gt; We will not pass through the Great Filter. This planet will be our collective grave, and the funeral oration is already beginning. \n\nAnd use it to justify *kidnapping and murdering people*:\n\n&gt; Blow up garment factories, kidnap oil executives\n\nIn short, this has nothing to do with philosophy.  You have simply taken old communist rhetoric, dressed it up in a coat of alarmist paint, and tried to pass it off as an argument, even though your premise is faulty, your logic is utterly inconsistent, and your conclusion relies solely on the reader taking your words as gospel.\n\nThis is not philosophy.  This is propaganda.  And it is propaganda which advocates violent action against people who have done nothing wrong.\n\n**TL;DR: This is collectivist propaganda, not philosophy.**", "id": "dxfv606", "parent_id": "t3_8ci2xl"}, {"body": "I think it\u2019s super cool that you are giving thought to something that I have been struggling to come to terms with myself.

Cahn wants to distinguish his own view from a view exemplified by Wolf, Kraut, Darwall, and Badhwar, but what do their views have in common that his doesn't? \n\n* Wolf: A good life requires active engagement in \"projects of worth.\"\n\n* Kraut: A good life requires \"possessing, developing, and enjoying cognitive, affective, sensory, and social powers.\"\n\n* Darwall: A good life requires \"focusing on things that matter, such as beauty and knowledge.\"\n\n* Badhwar: A good life requires \"wholeheartedness, i.e. 'an integrated intellectual-emotional disposition to live autonomously.'\"\n\nCahn's characterization of these theorists is that they all fail to tolerate the variety of good lives. He wants to say, \"*Their* theory puts restrictions on the variety, *mine* doesn't.\" But it's not that Cahn refuses to set up any requirements for a good life (he's not a total relativist), he just sets up *different* requirements than the other theorists. \n\n&gt;So long as people act within ethical bounds, their lives are surely of worth. And if they find satisfaction, let us not say that their lives have been a failure. \n\nSo we get:\n\n* Cahn: A good life requires satisfaction within ethical bounds. (That's all.)\n\nThere's a logical difference: The above four only give necessary conditions, but Cahn gives both necessary *and sufficient.* So it seems to me that Cahn's only justification for lumping together the other theorists is that they all disagree with his \"That's all\"--they all have *extra requirements.* \n\nBut we should ask two questions about that:\n\n1. Why assume that they all agree with his requirements in the first place and only differ in going on to add more? Wolf, Kraut, Darwall, and Badhwar could all be proposing their conditions as *alternatives* to Cahn's, not *additions.* (In that case, they're only united in *not* proposing the specific requirements Cahn does, and it's obviously not true that *every* alternative to Cahn's requirements must be guilty of variety-intolerance.)\n\n2. Couldn't it be that the other four theorists' requirements are actually just different interpretations of Cahn's own requirements? Cahn seems to interpret \"satisfaction\" hedonically and \"ethical bounds\" altruistically: satisfaction is about feeling content and not depressed/anxious/etc., and ethics is about respecting others and minimizing their distress. (Perhaps Wolf's requirement is a requirement *for satisfaction,* or *for staying within ethical bounds,* or both--on another interpretation of these terms than Cahn's.)\n\nMy last thought on the article is a bit more complicated. It goes like this: Cahn has two requirements, satisfaction and ethics. The former has a pretty good claim to being subjective. So Cahn might say his theory is unrestrictive because its requirement is subjective. But then there's his second requirement. Now, Cahn could say that the altruism of his ethical requirement is rooted in subjectivity as well--respecting others is just about not decreasing their subjective satisfaction. But there's a well-known family of philosophical problems surrounding the fact that while we seem to have obvious reasons to do things that will subjectively satisfy us, it's more difficult to explain our reasons to do things that won't, such as things that will only satisfy others. Now, even if Cahn roots his ethical-altruistic requirement in subjectivity, he has still introduced the difficult, non-obvious class of reasons in addition to the easy, obvious class. If we can have reasons for action that do not relate to our own subjective satisfaction but to that of others, then our subjective satisfaction is not the only criterion at work. If it's legitimate to restrict the variety of good lives by introducing *some* non-subjective requirements (e.g. ethical altruism), why is it illegitimate to restrict that variety by introducing *other* non-subjective requirements (e.g. eudaimonic, teleological, aesthetic, intellectual ones)?", "id": "dxidbfg", "parent_id": "t3_8cvgs0"}, {"body": "Not sure what is good in life but I know what is best in life.

Many people in our society would chalk up his uncharacteristic\nbehaviors to a \u201cmidlife crisis,\u201d a period of dramatic self-questioning and turbulence in middle age (40 to 60 years old), as one confronts mortality, physical decline,\nand unful filled hopes and dreams.\nThe idea that many people experience a difficult life transition when poised roughly midway between birth and death isn\u2019t of recent vintage. In the 14th century,\nthe first lines of Alighieri Dante\u2019s (1265\u20131321) epic poem the Divine Comedy evoked the idea of a midlife crisis:\nMidway upon the journey of our life I found\nmyself within a forest dark,\nFor the straightforward pathway had been lost.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until 1965 that Elliott Jacques coined the term \u201cmidlife crisis\u201d to describe the compulsive attempts to remain young and defy the reality of death that he\nobserved in middle-aged artists and composers. Jacque served up this catchy phrase for the public and scientific commun ity to describe virtually any unsettling life\ntransition people experience in middle age. A decade later, Gail Sheehy\u2019s (1976) bestselling book, Passages: Predictable Crises of Adult Life, cemented the idea of\na mid-life crisis in the public imagination. By 1994, 86% of young adults sur veyed believed in the reality of a \u201cmidlife crisis\u201d (Lachman, Lewkowicz, Marcus, &amp;\nPeng, 1994).\nThe film industry has pounced all over the idea of a turbulent period in midlife by depicting goofy and screwed up, yet likeable, middle aged guys\u2014the\nprotagonists are mostly male\u2014who question the meaning and value of their lives. In City Slickers (1991), three men (played by Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, and\nBruno Kirby), all experiencing a midlife crisis, take a 2-week break from their humdrum lives to go on a cattle drive from New Mexico to Colorado. A more recent\nriff on the same theme, the movie Wild Hogs (2007), portrays the adventures of four middle-aged men who hit the road on motorcycles to rekindle the excitement of\ntheir youth. No movie captures the supposed rut of middle age better than Groundhog Day (1993), in which comedian Bill Murray portrays Phil Connors, a heavy\ndrinking, self-absorbed weatherman, who\u2019s fated to repeat the same day, every day, until he finally \u201cgets\u201d that his life can have meaning when he becomes a better\nperson. In Bull Durham (1988), Kevin Costner portrays baseball player \u201cCrash\u201d Davis, exiled to the minor leagues to coach a talented young player. Crash is\nkeenly aware of his youth sliding away, much like his waning ability to slide safely into home plate, but he eventually finds love and fulfillment with baseball\ngroupie Annie Savoy (played by Susan Sarandon). In the Academy Award-winning movie, American Beauty (1999), Lester Burnham (played by Kevin Spacey)\ndisplays all of the stereotypic hall marks of a male midlife crisis. He quits his high pressure job to work as a burger turner, starts to use drugs and works out, buys a\nsports car, and becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter\u2019s girlfriend.\nThe Internet and books provide advice to help people negotiate not only their midlife crisis but their spouse\u2019s crisis as well. That\u2019s right: Women aren\u2019t immune to\nmidlife angst either. The Internet site for the Midlife Club (http://midlifeclub.com/) warns its visitors that: \u201cWhether it\u2019s your midlife crisis, or the midlife crisis of\nsomeone you love, whether you\u2019re a man or a woman\u2014you\u2019re in for a bumpy ride!\u201d The club peddles books in which men and women who \u201cmade it through the\ncrisis\u201d share their wisdom, strategies, and stories with one another.

He\ndiscovered that editors used the term \u201cmidlife crisis\u201d an average of twice a month to headline reviews of books, films, and tele vision programs.\nIn addition to Internet and media coverage, another reason why the notion of a midlife crisis may persist is that it\u2019s based on a shard of truth. Psychologist Erik\nErikson (1968) observed that in middle adult hood, most people grapple with finding direction, meaning, and purpose in their lives, and they strive to find out\nwhether there\u2019s a need for a mid-course correction. We\u2019ll see that Erikson exaggerated the prevalence of a crisis in middle age, but he was right that some people\nexperience marked self-doubt in the intermediate years of life. Yet people reevalu-ate their goals and priorities and experience crises in every decade of life, as\nevidenced by the emotional tumult some (but by no means all; see Myth #7) teens experience. Moreover, the experiences that fall under the umbrella of the \u201cmidlife\ncrisis\u201d are very broad\u2014such as change of job, divorce, buying a sports car\u2014and nebulous. As a consequence, one could consider most any upheaval or life change\nproof positive of a midlife meltdown.\nSome \u201csymptoms\u201d of a midlife crisis, such as divorce, are actually more likely to occur prior to middle age. In the United States, people first divorce, on average,\nwithin 5 years of marriage, at age 33 for men and 31 for women (Clarke, 1995). Moreover, when people purchase their fantasy sports car in their 40s, it may have\nnothing to do with making the best of a crisis. Rather, they may finally be able to make the payments on the car for which they longed as teenagers.\nStudies across cultures provide no fodder for the idea that middle age is a particularly stressful and difficult period. In a study of 1,501 Chinese married adults\nbetween 30 and 60 years old, Daniel Shek (1996) failed to find high levels of dissatisfaction approaching a \u201ccrisis\u201d in the majority of middle-aged men and women.\nResearchers funded by The Mac Arthur Foundation studied a total of nearly 7,195 men and women aged 25 to 74, of whom 3,032 were interviewed in the largest\nstudy of people at midlife (Brim, Ryff, &amp; Kessler, 2004). Contrary to the popular stereotype, people in the 40 to 60 age range generally felt more in control of their\nlives and expressed greater feelings of well-being compared with the previous decade of their lives. In addition, more than three quarters of respondents rated their\nrelationships as good to excellent. Men and women were equally likely to experience what they considered to be a midlife crisis. The researchers found that\nconcerns about having a midlife crisis were more common than actually experiencing a crisis. \n\n&gt; Several other findings debunk the myth of the midlife crisis. Across studies, only 10\u201326% (depending on how scientists define the midlife crisis) of people report\nthey\u2019ve experienced a midlife crisis (Brim, 1992; Wethington, 2000). In addition, middle age can be a period of peak psy chological functioning (Lachman, 2003).\nClearly, a midlife crisis isn\u2019t a prospect for everyone, or even a likely occurrence. So if you want to make radical changes in your life, and buy a red sports car or a\n\u201cwild hog\u201d motorcycle, it\u2019s never too early\u2014and never too late\u2014to do so.\n\nExcerpt taken from this book:\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6836438-50-great-myths-of-popular-psychology\n", "id": "dxp80e2", "parent_id": "t3_8do2jf"}, {"body": "One of the main reason i\u2019m so thankful i discovered stoicism in my 20s.

Then, in a sudden change of heart, he appears to suggest that there is nothing surprising about what they are witnessing, and nothing that needs any explanation. He says \u2018\u2026each individual coin spun individually is as likely to come down heads as tails and therefore should cause no surprise each individual time it does.\u2019 In this article I argue that Guildenstern is right \u2013 there is nothing surprising about throwing 92 heads in a row.

The article claims that if probability and surprise are related, then observing 92 H in a row, should be as surprising as observing any other sequence, as they are all equally likely to occur.   This misses the fact, that most people can't really observe a sequence of 92 things in its entirety.  An alternative setup would be to partition the sequences into two equivalence classes: one containing easy to recognize sequences (e.g., all H, all T, etc.), and the rest.  At length 92, there are a lot more sequences that are difficult to recognize, and so observing such a sequence is much more likely, which is why it is not surprising.", "id": "dxqi2m0", "parent_id": "t3_8dw08a"}, {"body": "Pro reading tip: When you get through the first bit of a piece, be it a paragraph, a sentence or two, or the first or several pages, and you find yourself thinking the writer must be an idiot, have a little faith that the writer is actually pointing out something simple or absurd to make a much larger point, and look for it to be so.

It will also make your reading experience much more enjoyable and less stressful.", "id": "dxqk1yy", "parent_id": "t3_8dw08a"}, {"body": "Throwing 92 heads in a row is an exceedingly unlikely event, about 1/5e27. Of course, it is just as unlikely as every other possible throw. Throwing heads on every odd throw and tails on every even also has a probability of about 2e-28.\n\nThe thing is, human beings do not classify the outcome of 92 throws into 5e27 categories. We classify it into maybe a handful of categories. One possible classification scheme is: about 50/50 | more heads than tails (~70/30) | less heads than tails (~30/70) | all throws come up one side.\n\nIn this scenario, getting 92 heads is legitimately **astronomically** more surprising than getting about 50/50.\n\nThe author discusses this on pages 4 and 5 in a slightly different way, but for me thinking about it in categories makes it more clear that we *should* be surprised at a run of all heads. We aren't comparing one exact prediction to another, we're comparing one category of result to another.\n\n&gt;\"We shouldn't believe the sequences [at the ends of the bellcurve] won't come up, while keeping an open mind about the sequences [near the center of the bell curve]. There are no grounds for this -- the sequences are all on par.\"\n\n I do not think that the author has sufficiently justified this point. The bell curve shows exactly the opposite, that an outcome near 50/50 is *not* on par with an outcome of all heads. Of course, you can't 100% discount the all heads outcome. But the entire point of probabilities is that you can 99.9% discount it.\n\n&gt;\"In fact we could pick *any* set of 3,700 trillion sequences, on whatever basis we like, and it will be approx. 73.8% probable that the actual sequence will be one in the set\"\n\nThis is a much more interesting argument, and the reason I wanted to talk about things in terms of human-centric categorizations. It is, of course, true. But I don't think that it proves the point the author wants it to. If there is something significant to you about the partition of sequences predicated on having at least two heads or two tails in a row (ie all sequences except HTHTHTHT... and THTHTHTH...), then it absolutely should be surprising to you if one of those two throws are made on the first try. It is perfectly logical to assume that a more likely event (not getting one of those two throws) will happen over a less likely event.\n\n&gt;\"Whatever the truth, it can't \"just so happen\" that the car is gone now and there is nothing more to the story\"\n\nYes, it absolutely can \"just so happen\". An unbelievable amount of electrons in the car could have tunneled in such a way that a critical amount of the structural bonds in the car broke, turning it into dust that was carried away on the wind. A 5th dimensional wormhole could have sucked it into the other side of the universe. I don't mean to say that either is literally possible, just that such phenomena may exist. But if they do, they are so extremely *unlikely* that one would be irrational to believe that they had happened. So instead you look for the *more likely* explanation. \n\nMy point is that any \"event that demands explanation\" does so because the current explanations seem too unlikely, and you hope for a more likely one. And so we are back to probability underlying (rational) surprise. Of course, a bad understanding of probability can lead you to surprise at a likely event, in which case an explanation of the actual statistics can satisfy that surprise. So maybe explanations having something to do with surprise in that way.\n\nIDK, I didn't have strong opinions on this topic this morning, I'm probably just reflexively playing devils advocate.

The probability of a fair coin landing on the same face 92 times in a row is 1/2^91, or one in 2.5 octillion^1. When you flip a coin and encounter this result, it is wrong to conclude \"This is a fair coin and we're having a lucky streak with nothing else going on.\" A more likely conclusion is that something else is going on - for example, we are flipping an unfair coin, or as Guildenstern initially says, unnatural forces are at work.\n\nLet's assume there are a billion coins in circulation, and conservatively estimate that just one of these coins is weighted, causing it to always land on the same side. Using Bayes' Theorem, we start with the prior knowledge that we have a 999,999,999/1,000,000,000 chance the coin we use is fair. But after 92 flips land on heads, we can conclude with near-certainty that we have a weighted coin^2.\n\nGuildenstern came to the wrong conclusion because he used a purely frequentist approach to this problem. This is understandable because Bayes' Theorem was not developed until 1763. But the author of this paper should have considered Bayes before agreeing with Guildenstern's conclusion.

Macrostates that are more likely contain more microstates.

The design process of the American republic relies upon elitist and mass force being kept in check like a swinging pendulum. Looking away from the routineering of the author in which he tries to come up with better design points and towards big ideas, the big picture: the conflict precedes the implementation of a democracy. Remember, \u201cdemocracy\u201d as we know it was a response to authoritarian tendencies at the time such as the divine right of kings and more. Ultimately, democracy in at true sense was never implemented but a balancing act between elitist and democratic forces.

Much of it resides in the mass and much of it has been taken by the elite, such as American foreign policy still on its faithful mission to fulfill manifest destinies and whatnot.

He calls these \"self-forming actions\" (SFA). For some reason, he considers this to be libertarian free will, even though it's just a combination of deterministic and random behavior.\n\nThere are big problems with any kind of free will that depends on randomness: \n\nFirstly, **it's indistinguishable from something completely deterministic**. Imagine a surgeon replaces the random parts of your brain with an implant that uses a precalculated list of random data. You now behave exactly like you have free will, but you don't, and you aren't responsible for anything you do.\n\nYou could argue that the implant is *effectively* random, and so you are *effectively* free, but that is the argument for compatibilism. Randomness is no longer metaphysically important, only epistemically important.\n\nBut the larger problem is that **randomness is necessarily worse than something completely determinstic**. Imagine that instead of a random number generator, the surgeon implants a crystal ball that always knows exactly the right thing to do. Now, you don't have free will, but you make *better* decisions than someone who does.\n\nSo, if free will is just a chance to randomly fuck up, do you really want it?? Sure, you argue. You're not truly free without the risk of failure.\n\nAlright, imagine the surgeon puts a slot in your head, and sends you home with two different implants: a crystal ball that's always right, and a true random number generator. You can only use one at a time, but you can switch whenever you like. How often will you use the \"free will\" implant that makes mistakes, instead of the one that's always right? How much freedom do you want?\n\nOr, imagine you have to choose one implant to be permanently in your brain, but you can carry the other one in your pocket, and it notifies you whenever it disagrees with your brain implant. If you get the crystal ball in your brain, how often will you ignore it and follow the wrong advice your \"free will\" is giving you? If the \"free will\" is in your brain, how often will you ignore the crystal ball's notification that you are making a mistake?\n\nAnd why not introduce some randomness into perfectly obvious decisions, to make yourself even more free?

I think what he is suggesting is that we should understand how we may interpret things, and be more cynical.\n\nStupidity refers to an unusual lack of basic human reason. So to say all humans are stupid is a contradiction of its definition.\n\nWhat he means is that all humans are subject to irrational reason. In that given a scenario, humans will make decisions or interpretations based on un-important factors.\n\nThere are two types of examples in the article. Decision making and interpretation. E.g. choosing a bottle of wine and tasting wine.\n\nIf French background music increases the sales of French wine, that to me suggests the creation of a positive association with French culture. Music is typically enjoyable, so by playing French music, the customer has greater affinity for French culture. It is not a conscious thought, but a subconscious one. Our brains do a lot of work without us thinking about it. And this example is irrational. Why should the wine be good because the music is good?\n\nIf you fool a wine tester with the color of the wine, that is because the human brain must make sense of what it senses. As the author alludes, eating and drinking is basically a full body experience. Sight is very much a part of the process.\n\nNow the brain has a lot of experience. It also knows a lot of stuff. Through this information and experience the brain will subconsciously associate certain colours and textures with certain expectations. Even the name of the wine may cause the taster to expect certain features. Thus they may experience them more noticeably. If you tell someone \"this wine was aged in a wooden barrel\" they may expect and ultimately experience a certain flavor even if it wasn't, like a placebo effect.\n\nThis is rational in a sense, because presented with 'facts' your brain will find a result they best satisfies the criteria. However it is still irrational since your brain will use these associations such as colour and sound to influence your experience.\n\nYour brain is not a HDD. Associations are like a flexible way of storing information, so I would not consider their influence to be a sign of stupidity.\n\nBut it is good to recognise how us as humans can be influenced by external factors.

I've never really seen why Foucault's work can't be useful to Marxism.\n\n----\n\n&gt;He pin\u00adpointed Heide\u00adg\u00adger\u2019s sup\u00adport for Nazism and Fou\u00adcault\u2019s sup\u00adport for Khomein\u00adism as de\u00adriv\u00ading from their at\u00adtempt to re\u00adcast his\u00adtor\u00adic\u00adal non-iden\u00adtity as on\u00adto\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adal dif\u00adfer\u00adence.\n\nI guess I'm methodologically less interested in what thinkers supported politically and more interested in how their thought comes to be. The *materialist* view I feel would be to attempt to trace Heidegger's thought back to material/empirical experience rather than dismiss his thought as having fascist implications (because, if it does, I'm really not seeing it in his later works). I think Debord's analysis is worthwhile here. The experience of a breakdown of reified thought (spectacle), or of the Western philosophical tradition's weaknesses becoming apparent even the Spectacular exchange of images (as Spectacle inherits this weakness), inspired Heidegger's inquiry, and even if his politics often leaning the opposite direction I don't see why Marxists wouldn't be interested in this. \n\nHeidegger's project shifting from existential phenomenology of Dasein to deconstruction of metaphysics actually runs parallel to Marx's shift from humanist critique (the language of species-being and alienation) to a critique of political economy (the analysis of the exchange, one could even say 'discourse' of commodities). In both cases, the subject of inquiry shifts from an analysis of human beings in the world to a critique of the system at work (in Marx it's the exchange of commodities, Heidegger's case, the 'economy' of presence or metaphysics). I'm really summing this up but the first section of Reiner Schurmann's *Heidegger on Being and Acting* explains it very thoroughly.\n\nMy point being that I'm becoming very annoyed with 'Marxists' putting their materialism aside to attack a thinker's politics. Instead, we should look at Heidegger's thought as a criticism of how metaphysical systems function within history, something very useful to *Ideologiekritik*.", "id": "dy4bui2", "parent_id": "t3_8fka66"}, {"body": "Maybe I\u2019m missing the whole point here.

Are dogs idiots for not speaking English? Humanity and it\u2019s brain are in process of rapid evolution.  People are a result of the culture around them. They are in essence who they have been taught to be.

In other words through out history we have seen highly evolved thinkers who changed history and current misconceptions in science, religion etc. today everyone fancies themselves an individual thinker, even when they are not. In the same way this country said every man is created equal (and yet at the time they were treated so differently...but that ideal spread into consciousness and we have today where every person is equal in the legal since...but there are still individuals who continue to be backward thinkers, mainly elderly. But in a few more generations the dream will be reality. ) \nThe idealism of individualists and a race of humans who look at the world through the goggles of resin instead of religion or emotion is in the process of becoming a reality. \n\nTo all the thinkers who loose patients with their fellow man, who think they are surrounded by idiots and can\u2019t stand the culture that surrounds them I say patient. Don\u2019t give into the idea of fuck them all..or that the only answer is to destroy humanity and start over (religion has the apocalypse and sci fi has AI...but it\u2019s both from the same desire to wipe humanity clean because it\u2019s too complicated and difficult to watch the growing pains) \n\nAnd also I challenge u to think about IQ as a gift same as beauty or wealth. No person is inherently better than another because they were born more beautiful or more intelligent. And if u are lucky enough to have something more than the person next to u it is better to share than to hoard it. And approach is everything. U can\u2019t throw money in someone\u2019s face and say take it! Your poor and I\u2019m rich so it\u2019s my job to help u.

We can\u2019t operate outside of the parameters of our context, nurture and nature. And our beliefs aren\u2019t built solely on conscious processes. In that respect we are absolutely not responsible for our actions. We tend to look at high profile clinically diagnosed psychopaths and say, \u201cWell they really had no choice in the matter. They have a disease.\u201d But that disease is based on a societal norm of what a sound mind is. We all have predispositions. It\u2019s just that we tend ignore them when they\u2019re normalized and fit within the boundaries of what is acceptable.\n\nBut we don\u2019t live in a philosophical construct.

As pointed out in the post, the more time some has under their belt, the more opportunity they have to refine their beliefs based on the world around them... for better or for worse.

And that internal world isn\u2019t just a set of facts. It\u2019s an identity. And if that internal world is destroyed my uneducated guess is that people feel that they are also being destroyed. So belief isn\u2019t really the only actor in this.\n\nStill our social construct requires us to hold people responsible as rational actors.

The extent to which 'environment' influences beliefs/values is so obviously massive, I'd wager it subsumes all other contributing factors. \n\nFor example, a lot of people have beliefs that are rooted in being totally naive about certain dynamics of this world.

All sorts of coy observations about the different worldview of people who have been mugged versus people who haven't. \n\nThe normative value of a given set of 'beliefs' will be largely tied to popular social imperatives as well, which will vary (sometimes wildly) from culture to culture.

Some languages have a sharp distinction between past, present, and future, and others are more nebulous and don't necessarily specify the time. Supposedly, by removing the temporal component in the language, people are conditioned to see the future self as the same as present self, which means saving now to help your future self is the same as helping your present self.

All humans are persons.\n2. All fetuses in a woman are human.\n3. Therefore, all fetuses are persons. \n\nPerson being an agent that has rights such as life, liberty, and property. So, according to this internal logic, if you can qualify a fetus as a person then you have automatically bestowed rights to it. That would mean that taking its life qualifies as murder.\n\nLooking more towards your example there, there are some things to take notice of. When you say, woman's right to bodily autonomy then there are a few things to consider. Firstly, where does this right come from. As we know, rights come from all kinds of places--depending on the authority, that authority may or may not be contestable; this also applies to the pro-life arguments but the same diligence should be taken in questioning authority because you manage to dismantle the wrong authority, you will find that all other things that authority gave out as rights to us are also in jeopardy. Secondly, why is autonomy constricted to the body? What about autonomy in general. Do we arrive at problems when we decide that autonomy extended to other areas of a woman produce unexpected consequences. For instance, if the woman is assaulting someone then does she revoke her right to autonomy and allow a physician to administer chemical restraints. \n\nNot to dwell too long on the left side, but turning towards the right: There are the classic questions of just what exactly is a person. It is an abstraction that was created but one with enormous consequences. If you strip another human's person-hood then you will have free reign to enslave or genocide them. Here, too, there is an issue of authority because some people think that person-hood is decided by god, etc. Another complication is the area of psychology because we seem to bestow and revoke person-hood on an individual basis. For example, some people do not see cats and dogs as persons but others do; that disagreement holds great sway over the behavior of people and how they treat animals. If you look at someone talk to their dog like it is a person, it may just be because they actually think it is one beyond their own intentions. It seems that a person is the conceptualization of something occurring beneath the level of awareness. Things get muddied when you suddenly realize that like cats and dogs, some humans see a fetus as a person and some do not-psychologically. This is another tricky area. \n\nYour confusion about rights is not unmerited: rights are completely abstract creations with each one coming out of a system of its own internal logic. It does not seem that there will ever be any such thing as an \"absolute right\" that transcends all perspectives. Instead, it will always be mired in the murky pool of human subjectivity. If there were ever a victor in the battle of abortion then it more signifies a change in power distribution in society or elected officials than it does an argument being proven right.

The government at the time commissioned a work-group to figure out how the newly discovered oil could best benefit the country and it's people, in both the short and long term. To solve that challenge they actually hired skilled academic philosophers, and they advised a model where Norway and it's people got full control over the resources and where the wealth were used to pay for a welfare state.\n\nAnother example is that today that wealth is invested in the global financial markets. Around 1% of the stocks in the world are owned by Norway. They use philosophers such as Henrik Syse to help decide how to best invest the wealth, i.e. invest in ways that mitigates harm to the planet and to people etc.\n\nOther examples are contemporary Philosophy of law and Political philosophy which have effects not just in the present but will also have effects in the future, though it can be hard to quantify these effects. Ethics has very tangible real world applications, for instance in the form of research ethics which limits what can and can't be done in terms of research.

Paradoxically our interest is to keep the environment from collapsing so we have to intelligently nurture it. This essay is essentially arguing for unregulated capitalism in nature, which causes the privileged few to explode in wealth and the vulnerable minorities to starve which causes the economy to collapse.

What's at stake is a future where food is scarce, humans and animals starve to death by the billions, and wars are fought over the last remaining scraps of a desolate wasteland. Deep down, that's what drives ecological preservation efforts, not some lovey dovey notion of the moral value of white headed ducks.\n\nNow, ecology is incredibly complex, and efforts related to individual duck or deer populations are probably often very misguided attempts at controlling systems we barely understand. But they are also reactions to a blithe lack of regard to anything other than extraction of short term economic value from the environment; to situations where humans have already negatively impacted individuals, species, and entire ecosystems. \n\nSo, the author values individual experiences here and now, and has more moral consideration of nonhuman animals even than most ecologists.

This logic, of course, extends naturally to humans.

Humans are the great homogenizers, bringing animals and plants from one place to another, intentionally or unintentionally, and creating a world far more homogeneous than would otherwise be. By the article's logic, humans are allowed to create genocide against species indirectly, by introducing invasive species into an environment that cannot protect itself, but not allowed to correct the mistake by creating another genocide by direct methods to protect the native environment. It's asymmetrical because the introduction of non-native animal that creates a genocide is binned in the \"non-ethical\" role, because the actions of animal and plant are outside of ethical consideration, but the genocide of a species by direct means by humans fall under ethical consideration because the killing is by human hand. \n\nMaybe this asymmetry is at the heart of what you mean by \"speciest\".

For example if I were to use a pesticide to completely wipe out a species of tree, driving that species to extinction, my fellow humans would have an ethical problem with that. For one thing I would be irrevocably harming our common environment, but there is also a presumption that any extant plant species on earth today have a kind of \"right\" to life. We value biodiversity for its own sake, and we value species simply because they have managed to survive... we feel as though they \"deserve\" to survive, or at least that it would be wrong for us to destroy their chances for survival.

A rock has no mind, no feelings, no intentions.  We do not consider a rock morally culpable during a landslide that kills a person (we aren't going to send a rock to prison or condemn it to hell) and in general we do not give a generic rock's wellbeing any consideration in questions of ethics and morality (with rare exception for those rock formations that *humans* value).  \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum we have humans.  Humans have minds, intelligence, sentience, sapience, agency, etc., whatever you want to call it.

If a human causes a landslide's damage they are culpable, and if we must break a few humans to do a thing we do give their negative outcomes moral and ethical weight in a way we would not for a generic rock. \n\nI believe and would argue the reason we give weight to the outcomes of humans instead of rocks in moral and ethical questions ultimately boils down to their agency, intellect, sapience, mind, etc., or some combination of the former.  \n\nSo what about animals?  Animals are not rocks.

In fact Camus argues at considerable length to show that an act of conscientious revolt is ultimately far more than just an individual gesture or an act of solitary protest.

Forests are half the size they were in 1978. And deforestation is accelerating, not decelerating.

Again, where does that leave us for carbon sequestration and oxygen production?\n\n&gt; The frozen methane locked in shallow Arctic sea beds and in Arctic permafrost soils have already begun to outgas a decade ago: constant streams of bubbles fizz to the surface from thousands of seeps, and on land sometimes in spectacular explosions that leave massive craters that look like the aftermath of an artillery bombardment across Siberia. That pace is accelerating faster than scientists thought. We know methane is some 100 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon, but there is also twice the amount of carbon locked in these Arctic regions than currently exists in the atmosphere, ready to let go.\n\n&gt; The runaway train ain\u2019t stopping.

I develop this approach in my book Sex, Culture, and Justice. There I argue that choices are normatively problematic if they are characterised by the disadvantage factor and the influence factor.

The influence factor applies if we can identify ways that people are influenced, or encouraged, to make that choice. If both the influence and disadvantage factor are present then the choice is normatively problematic or unjust. And we have particular reason to worry if the influence is coming from people who do not themselves make the disadvantageous choice.\n\nOne example I use in the book is the choice to become a full-time housewife, who devotes her time to domestic and caring work and is financially dependent on a breadwinning spouse. Now, being a housewife has various advantages, such as being able to spend time with children. But it brings with it a very serious disadvantage of financial dependence, and that dependence can be hard to reverse since it can be difficult to return to a career after extended time away. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that there is necessarily anything unjust about a woman choosing to become a housewife. A woman may decide that the benefits of time with her children are worth the costs of financial dependence. However, there are also many ways that women are influenced or encouraged to focus on caring work at the expense of their own financial security. The idea that mothers in particular should devote themselves to their children is very strong in many societies, with women made to feel that they are doing something wrong if they prioritise their careers. Men, on the other hand, are made to feel that they are doing something wrong if they prioritise their families. (Joan Williams writes about this norm in her excellent book Unbending Gender.) So women are strongly influenced to prioritise caring work over financial independence, which means that they fact that they choose to do so is not enough to make the situation just.\n\nIn response, we could try to mitigate either the disadvantage factor, or the influence factor, or both. In this example, mitigating disadvantage would mean providing financial safeguards, pay, or benefits for housewives and full-time carers; providing support for women re-entering the workplace after time away; and ensuring that mothers, carers and women in general are not discriminated against. Workplaces should become more family-friendly and flexible. Mitigating influence would mean that we should encourage both women and men to think that parenting is their responsibility and that they can succeed in the workplace even after having children.\n", "id": "dxgifqe", "parent_id": "t1_dxgfe3s"}, {"body": "Thanks for the question. My work is focused on contemporary analytical liberalism, and I discuss in Sex, Culture, and Justice the different ways that contemporary liberals rely on the concept of choice. In that book I have extended discussions of Brian Barry and Martha Nussbaum, who are interesting precisely because both philosophers do recognise the significance of culture yet still rely on choice to play a crucial role. \n\nI've also written a lot about political liberalism, particularly as developed by John Rawls, to try to uncover the implications and limitations of that approach. I think that political liberalism has very significant implications, such that political liberals should oppose generally-accepted practices such as state-recognised marriage (because it violates liberal neutrality) and infant circumcision (because it undermines individual choice).

Now we call this rape, but in England and Wales it is only since 1991 that the law has recognised the crime of rape within marriage.

I don't argue for the termination of collective property ownership. Even in a marriage regime marriage is not the only way of owning something with someone else: non-marital contracts are also possible. You can buy a house or other property together with your friend, or your parents, or your business partner - or your unmarried life partner. Ending state-recognised marriage wouldn't change that.\n\nThese are generally examples of contractual co-ownership. The state always has to have laws in place that determine who owns property, and whether the only way to get a stake in some property is contractual or whether there can be other ways. For example, who owns a house? Is it just the person whose name is on the deeds? Or does someone who contributes financially to the house, perhaps by paying some of the mortgage, thereby get a stake? Do you become entitled to a stake in some property if you contribute to it with unpaid labour, such as caring or domestic work? \n\nIn my book I don't give answers to specific policy questions such as these. We will all have different views and settling these questions would take many more books! Instead I argue that each reader should consider what she or he thinks is the most just way of regulating unmarried people who engage in relationship practices such as being financially dependent, or cohabiting, or parenting, or migrating, and then apply these rules to everyone.

Marriage is a relationship form that bundles together relationship practices such as cohabitation, financial dependence, sexual intimacy, monogamy, parenting, next-of-kinship, caring, permanence / commitment and so on. For many people these relationship practices are bundled together into one dominant relationship; but for many other people, they aren't. You might have children with one person but not or no longer have any other relationship with them. You might have caring responsibilities for elderly relatives and children, while living with a sexual partner.

Relationship practices need regulation either when they need to be determinate in law, or when there is vulnerability. For example, the law needs a way of determining who owns a house or other property, and it needs a way of determining who has parental responsibility, and it needs a way of determining who is next of kin, and so on, and so relationship practices pertaining to these questions need regulation.

As you say, mass incarceration is part of the reason for the difference in marriage patterns between white and black Americans, as is the legacy of slavery.

I'm pro abortion, and I'll argue against abortion if you like.\n\n**Edit**: I'll start us off...\n\n----\n\nFirst, I'd like to start by saying that whenever the issue of abortion is discussed, we almost inevitable end up having to address of abortion in the context of rape and incest. I believe that those are very important to talk about, but also need to be handled very very carefully as part of their own conversation.\n\nThe vast majority of abortions are not the result of rape, but instead elective procedures undergone by people under social and economic pressure to not have children. These abortions are not medically required, but instead come from cases where a couple failed to use protection, or used it improperly. The solution to accidental pregnancy is not abortion, but is instead better education and better access to birth control.\n\nI completely emphatize with someone caught in such a situation, however I do not feel that abortion should be used as a way of avoiding the responsibility of getting pregnant. Carrying a baby to term does not mean having to raise a child; adoption is always an option. In fact, in the United States there are huge waiting lists of adoptive parents who would like to have a child, but are not able to have one of their own, either due to medical issues, or due to their sexual orientation. An abortion really isn't a decision about becoming a mother and father, but instead a way to avoid pregnancy.\n\nI want to make it clear that abortion is an elective procedure in the vast majority of cases. I am not in any way arguing against medically necessary abortions.\n\nI do also realize that there is tremendous social pressure to hide pregnancy. However, I feel that abortion is not the solution to those problems. Instead, we should be working to de-stigmatize extra-marital sexuality, and we should be offering support and protection to those who become pregnant. I strongly believe that we as a society have an obligation to provide care and support for pregnant mothers so that they are not put into a place where they would want to abort a fetus to begin with.\n\nAnd again, I would like to emphasize that while a woman has absolute domain over her body, a fetus is not entirely of her body. An unborn baby is it's own unique, and individual life. It shares DNA from its mother, but also from its father. It depends on its mother, but it is not simply a lump of her tissue. With the availability and effectiveness of birth control, it's very difficult to justify terminating a life simply because that life wasn't created intentionally.\n\nRather than continuing to allow elective abortions, I strongly feel that we should limit them to cases where they are medically necessary. We should instead be addressing the social issues that create accidental pregnancies and cause people to seek abortions in the first place.", "id": "dxjylgd", "parent_id": "t1_dxjev9l"}, {"body": "Very few people are pro-abortion.

This comes from my personal experience and the observation of hyper-rational people who tend to discount \"irrational\" things like empathy, compassion and connection in favour of utilitarian or otherwise instrumental, cold-calculation value-judgements.\n\nIn other words, hyper-rationality, by overvaluing discursive thought, overlays a field of conceptualisation upon experience, causing us to see the world as a logic puzzle to be definitively solved, and others encountered as pieces to be moved and manipulated in search of this goal, rather than seeing the Other as something inherently ungraspable, ultimately indefinable in its totality and yet something we can enter into meaningful relationship with. \n\nThis overreliance on rationality is essentially based on fear, as it is easier to deal with something if we break it down into rationally digestible pieces rather than encounter ourselves and other beings in their wholeness, as something which our discursive minds cannot pin down and thus recoils from in horror - we are overwhelmed by the reality of existence and thus break it apart and create a distance between us and the world through the use of language and discursive thought.\n\nExcuse the ramble, this is just one of my key areas of interest ATM!

It seems many users here are taking over thinking to mean processing a cognitive train of thought too much, which I think could lead to over abstraction and the subsequent problems associated with it, but, as was pointed out by other users, doesn't necessarily lead to that.

It's entirely my own thoughts on the topic as I literally didn't read the article. Quel suprise. Sorry it's a wall of text lol:\n\n\nUnsurprisingly I haven't read the full blog post, but imo overthinking is often linked with overvaluing abstractions over direct lived experience and intuitive, non-discursive relations with others, which tends to lead to an instrumental relationship with one's environment - see all of science. This can be habitual and doesn't necessarily correlate with a conscious desire/decision to \"use\" others selfishly, it's more that rational thinking is tied into analysis, categorisation and objectification of the Other and not an organic, lived and non-reflexive/non-discursive relationship with it. \n\nThinking generally produces a distance between subject/object (real or otherwise) which is useful but can become pathological when relied on excessively. This comes from my personal experience and the observation of hyper-rational people who tend to discount \"irrational\" things like empathy, compassion and connection in favour of utilitarian or otherwise instrumental, cold-calculation value-judgements.\n\nIn other words, hyper-rationality, by overvaluing discursive thought, overlays a field of conceptualisation upon experience, causing us to see the world as a logic puzzle to be definitively solved, and others encountered as pieces to be moved and manipulated in search of this goal, rather than seeing the Other as something inherently ungraspable, ultimately indefinable in its totality and yet something we can enter into meaningful relationship with. \n\nThis overreliance on rationality is essentially based on fear, as it is easier to deal with something if we break it down into rationally digestible pieces rather than encounter ourselves and other beings in their wholeness, as something which our discursive minds cannot pin down and thus recoils from in horror - we are overwhelmed by the reality of existence and thus break it apart and create a distance between us and the world through the use of language and discursive thought.\n\nExcuse the ramble, this is just one of my key areas of interest ATM! To more directly address your point - You can be empathetic and still overthink; it just means you see problems to be solved in the world around you more than relations to be entered into and lived - we (myself included) tend to rely on rational solutions to what are often irrational situations. It is a state of being we are conditioned into through our particular use of language and cultural modes of thought (scientific instrumentalism). An alternative would be to see ourselves as an integral part of a larger whole, a part which can be tuned to be in greater harmony with that whole (vs having problems to be finally \"fixed\"), rather than seeing ourselves as a separate and distinct entity which can break things down and put them back together \"better\" - an inherently objectifying and instrumentalist perspective.", "id": "dxlo4qg", "parent_id": "t1_dxkjhz4"}, {"body": "I think we're all overthinking this.", "id": "dxkl4cp", "parent_id": "t1_dxkjhz4"}, {"body": "I think it's correct.

Really many of the problems (violence, misogyny, homophobia, etc.) are ubiquitous in many countries. Cambodians killed 4,000,000 of their countrymen under an atheistic regime in the 70s (and Cambodia was a mostly Buddhist population prior to that). Russia routinely kills dissidents and starts war in foreign countries. Mexico is a Catholic nation, yet 30k people were murdered there in gang warfare just last year. In fact, [take a look at the 30 countries with the highest murder rates in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate), you will find a lack of Muslim majority nations, and mostly Catholic/Christian ones. The most oppressive country in the world is North Korea. Russia, Uganda, Paraguay, and China have all recently passed homophobic laws.  Islam is responsible for some amount of homophobia, misogyny and violence in its country, but none of these things are unique to Islamic countries.          \n          \nIt also fails to acknowledge the role actions from Western countries have had in the formation of Radical Islam. Radical Islam came about during the 60s primarily as a way to fight against Western intervention in Muslim countries. Strict Muslim adherents made for passionate fighters willing to die for their cause. Conservative Islam in Iran proved very effective in removing the British imposed Shah from power. Conservative fighters helped rid Afghanistan of Russian control in the 80s. ISIS formed from the former commanders of Sadame's regime and was helped by the instability created by the West in Syria and Libya. End of the day, the second Gulf War had a casualty total of 500,000 civilians, including thousands of dead civilians directly from US soldiers and bombing campaigns. We are seeing now though, that during times of relative piece, conservatives are losing their stranglehold in the Middle East. Iran has started to see liberalization, Saudi Arabia has passed some liberal reforms (though obviously it still has ways to go). With ISIS mostly defeated, there have been far fewer attacks in its name recently. We just need to not help create another ISIS.           \n       \nAdditionally, a large majority of anti Western sentiment among Islamic nations is due to the ongoing support of Israel. Blame whoever you want for the current animosity between Palestinians and Israelis, but you still have to acknowledge that a bunch of European governments forcefully removing hundreds of thousands of native Palestinians from their homeland as repayment for a European country killing 6 million Jews was outrageous. What did the Palestinians do to deserve that fate?            \n        \nFinally, it is important to acknowledge difference in the spread of Islam in different places. In the US, for example, over the past 20 years less than 200 people have been killed by domestic Islamic Extremism (9/11 was not a domestic operation). Worrying about the spread of radical Islam in the US makes very little sense. In Europe, due to its close position to North Africa and Turkey, they certainly have more reason to be worried. But many of the rights problems with Muslims, is more economics based (tons of the British were happy to eject the migrant Poles from their country). Saying that all the problems with crime and poverty that Muslim immigrants bring is because they are Muslim, and not that they are poor is disingenuous. Even in the Middle East and South Asia, many of the conservative fighters are part of the movement for economic reasons. In the hills of Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda is one of the few \"employers\" and it allows you to earn a fair wage. ISIS also paid its soldiers a decent salary. When there are no other opportunities, people will join whoever offers them the ability to survive. Look to Germany in the 1930s to see this in action.        \n        \n**tl;dr:** Any attempt to single out Islam as singularly violent or ideologically backwards and refuses to acknowledge the impact the Western world has played in the growth of conservative/radical Islam most likely is either ignorant of the history of the movement, or deliberately promoting an anti-Islamic agenda.

Even if changing your mind about your religion would be such a huge psychological shift in your thinking that it would be hard to see someone as the same person they were before they changed their mind, the fact that it is theoretically possible (and in fact, happens all the time) is what makes it a 'choice', though perhaps not in the way you normally intuit the word 'choice'.\n\nInterestingly, because the act of transitioning from one gender to another is a specific act that can be chosen or not to chosen to do, that makes it an ideological commitment, and therefore (according to the author) something that can be legitimately criticised. Basically, you can't legitimately criticise a transgender person for being trans, but you can legitimately criticise them for transitioning. The easy rebuttal would be that criticising a trans person for transitioning would be like criticising a cancer patient for undergoing chemo, but I guess that's the big point of the author: the distinction between legitimate criticism and illegitimate criticism is *completely seperate* from the distinction between *correct* criticism and *incorrect* criticism, and equally (if not more) valid.\n\nI should note that I've been describing what I thought would be how the author would explain his ideas.

That concept, coupled with the idea that for a lot of people \"better schools\" means \"private schools,\" ultimately means that a voucher system takes money away from public schools (where it is desperately needed) and gives it to private schools.\n\nNow, if you assume that the poorest of the poor that are stuck in underfunded public schooling are minorities, you can see how some people might distill the entire issue down to a race issue.\n\nThe truth is, it's a poverty issue.", "id": "dxwr5de", "parent_id": "t1_dxwig9d"}, {"body": "It could be a moral taboo. That is, it could be the case that incest is not immoral, but also it's good that we have strong cultural norms against it, and we should keep it taboo. One reason to think it's good that incest is taboo is that wide acceptance of incest might cause significant damage to the sanctity of familial relations. \n\nConsider that in societies where homosexuality is well accepted, men are significantly *less* affectionate towards one another in platonic relationships. The fact that homosexuality is accepted means that affection  is coded as gay among male friends, especially physical affection, and this in turn makes men feel less comfortable expressing their platonic emotions to each other, especially not with physicality (ie. especially no hand holding and such, which is common among men in, for instance, Saudi Arabia). This can be, and usually is, true even among men who harbor no homophobic prejudice whatsoever -- the discomfort is not predicated on homophobic concerns. So the worry might be that if incest becomes more common, it could similarly affect family relationships in societies where this is accepted. It could make family members less physical with one another, less close and affectionate in various ways, just in order to avoid communicating incestual interest in a society where you might really come into contact with that, because it's accepted and less rare than it is now.\n\nWhereas the trade-off seems well worth it where the acceptance of homosexuality is concerned, it's unlikely that this equation balances out when it comes to incest. Accepting homosexuality has an enormously positive impact on gay people and society in general. Accepting incestual relations, on the other hand, is likely to have a much smaller impact, minuscule if any, and may even exacerbate existing problems like sexual abuse within families by fostering moral hazards of temptation. \n\nI like this way of putting it, moral taboo, and I think this way of thinking can be put to other matters. Polygamy may be another moral taboo, in that there doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with a man having lots of long term female partners raising his children, but at the same it's good for society that this is not the norm and that we have a strong cultural norm or taboo that discourages this.", "id": "dxxkn1j", "parent_id": "t1_dxwipe4"}, {"body": "I mean, if I'm being charitable here, the argument you seem to mean is something like\n\n* A is B\n\n* B is C\n\n* Therefore A is C.\n\nAlthough I don't understand what this has to do with the LEM.

What it does is highlight the intrinsic real subjectivity about any given supposed \"objective\" point. Without getting too much into the mechanisms of meaning making, my words functionally mean different things to me as they do to you (and sometimes mean different things to me as they do to me as a function of time!), which leaves us in a strange place in terms of how we can actually talk about things, seeing as how we are continually fighting this imperfect communication (for more on this, Barthes and Derrida). But, we can't let this paralyze us, and for all intents and purposes we can get enough done with what we have to send people to the moon; just be aware that it's happening beneath us. We can get close enough to talk about things as if they are true sometimes, but we must agree that there's a little play in our definitions and we aren't directly speaking at each other. \n\nBut PM and post-structural theorists (which is probably a better term for the philosophers engaged in the work) aren't going to say that statistics are not valid, and that every argument should be taken as valuable. For instance, they wouldn't deny that American prisons are disproportionately filled with people of color. This is a phenomenon that is impossible to deny; it is, according to the defined laws of statistics, a sound statement. But, it doesn't 'tell' the story of the American justice system. It gives a brief little insight from an outside perspective, outside being the crucial metaphor here, as it is still a specific position in relation to the system, and thus intrinsically subjective. That's not too important, as again, it's kind of arbitrary once we agree that we're talking truth from a statistics standpoint. But, the bigger 'grand narrative' they would deny is someone stating that it's because people of color are just more likely to commit crimes. Instead of that simple 'truth' that attempts to explain everything away to the \"structure\" of the PoC brain, they assert that there are cultural forces (like racism) influencing this phenomenon, there are economic forces (the economy of prison and cheap labor), there are formal political and legal forces (drug war), psychological forces (recidivism rates and addicts in prison) heck, even religious forces might be working here (a history of Western Christianity shapes how we view punishment). The crucial point about post-structuralist thought is that before it came about, each one of these specific lenses of analysis thought it was *the* correct way to look at a given phenomenon. Post-structuralism says no, all of these things not only influence the specific phenomenon, but also influence each other (racism influences political and legal forces, which influence economic forces, which feed back into solidifying racist beliefs, etc.).\n\nAnother way of putting all of this is that the truth, then, is not contained within a single 'objective' analysis, but is *continually worked towards* by the inclusion of multiple subjective experiences and narratives.\n\nBut anyway, back to politics and the language thing (Derrida from above): deconstruction is a dissenter's wet dream in terms of political opinion. It can be used to examine law and policy and reveal the hypocrisies within. The problem we face today is that we are dealing with nu-fascism: the subjects of hypocritical power are too busy watching football to do anything about it. \n\n(Because I'm feeling a bit playful): *CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING*: What would a post-structuralist (as I've presented them, anyway) say about the above comment?
