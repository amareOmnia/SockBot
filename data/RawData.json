The idea is that, for a concept to be scientifically tested, that it must be testable in some way (therefore, falsifiable/observable). A non-testable concept has more or less reached the limit of what science can be done on it. The truth of this, however, does not define the value of the idea - only the scientific testability of it.\n\nSome of the objections that the article gives in this vein are therefore a little silly - one passage mocks a falsifiable scientific theory because a scientist can 'patch it up' when they find evidence that it is false. The article doesn't seem to realise that this isn't called cheating - it's called updating your theory in the face of evidence, and is a cornerstone of what science is.\n\nThe rest of the article, more reasonably, points out that things previously not thought observable have become observable or falsifiable, bringing them into the realm of scientific testing. Sure. This does not change that they *did* have to be observable or falsifiable to be tested scientifically - the principle holds true. It's simply that some people were *wrong* about them. A large number of theoretical physicists and other professionals work every day under the assumption that our technology will keep expanding what it is we can observe.\n\nNone of this actually runs counter to the scientific method or a claim that a theory, to be scientifically testable, must be falsifiable or observable - and none of it really runs counter to how professionals in theoretical fields already operate, many of whom already are theorising currently untestable constructs with the understanding that they could conceivably be testable in the future. They key with these concepts is generally that we have reason to believe that test-ability and observability will come in the near future, given an understanding of our technology and the mechanics of our theories. Indeed, huge leaps are made based on the expectation of an observation happening or not (see: Higgs Boson).\n\nSo, what are we actually saying here? Not to make too many assumptions about what is and is not observable or falsifiable? The dangerous part about the way this article is constructed is the possible implication that we should accept *inherently* unobservable or unfalsifiable claims as a valid part of science. No, once they are testable, *then* we can do science on them. If something, by its nature, exists outside of testability, observability, falsifiability, it has no place in science until we discover that we were *wrong* about its nature.

In essence, it's a compatibilistic argument; because you have more than one option to choose from, you are free to choose. You may always choose the same one, based on your biases, upbringing etc. and maybe you will even hold steadfast against all evidence in that belief due to those same biases. Still, because it was an *option* to change those beliefs, that makes you able to choose.\n\nIt's simply impossible to change your race, or your gender identity, or your sexuality. In fact, your race, gender identity and sexuality are determined *irrespective* of any decision *you could have made*, save for somehow physically altering your body/mind with technology that doesn't yet exist. That does point to another interesting point: when/if technology does arise that could change your race/gender or sexuality, at that point choosing to change this *or even choosing not* to change it, would be an ideologically based decision, and this choice would be a choice that could attract legitimate criticism. One could argue that Rachel Dolezal acted immorally on this basis, and such an argument would be completely legitimate (if not necessarily uncontroversially true).\n\nThat's what makes religion a ideological identity. Even if changing your mind about your religion would be such a huge psychological shift in your thinking that it would be hard to see someone as the same person they were before they changed their mind, the fact that it is theoretically possible (and in fact, happens all the time) is what makes it a 'choice', though perhaps not in the way you normally intuit the word 'choice'.\n\nInterestingly, because the act of transitioning from one gender to another is a specific act that can be chosen or not to chosen to do, that makes it an ideological commitment, and therefore (according to the author) something that can be legitimately criticised. Basically, you can't legitimately criticise a transgender person for being trans, but you can legitimately criticise them for transitioning. The easy rebuttal would be that criticising a trans person for transitioning would be like criticising a cancer patient for undergoing chemo, but I guess that's the big point of the author: the distinction between legitimate criticism and illegitimate criticism is *completely seperate* from the distinction between *correct* criticism and *incorrect* criticism, and equally (if not more) valid.\n\nI should note that I've been describing what I thought would be how the author would explain his ideas.

It's entirely my own thoughts on the topic as I literally didn't read the article. Quel suprise. Sorry it's a wall of text lol:\n\n\nUnsurprisingly I haven't read the full blog post, but imo overthinking is often linked with overvaluing abstractions over direct lived experience and intuitive, non-discursive relations with others, which tends to lead to an instrumental relationship with one's environment - see all of science. This can be habitual and doesn't necessarily correlate with a conscious desire/decision to use others selfishly, it's more that rational thinking is tied into analysis, categorisation and objectification of the Other and not an organic, lived and non-reflexive/non-discursive relationship with it. \n\nThinking generally produces a distance between subject/object (real or otherwise) which is useful but can become pathological when relied on excessively. This comes from my personal experience and the observation of hyper-rational people who tend to discount irrational things like empathy, compassion and connection in favour of utilitarian or otherwise instrumental, cold-calculation value-judgements.\n\nIn other words, hyper-rationality, by overvaluing discursive thought, overlays a field of conceptualisation upon experience, causing us to see the world as a logic puzzle to be definitively solved, and others encountered as pieces to be moved and manipulated in search of this goal, rather than seeing the Other as something inherently ungraspable, ultimately indefinable in its totality and yet something we can enter into meaningful relationship with. \n\nThis overreliance on rationality is essentially based on fear, as it is easier to deal with something if we break it down into rationally digestible pieces rather than encounter ourselves and other beings in their wholeness, as something which our discursive minds cannot pin down and thus recoils from in horror - we are overwhelmed by the reality of existence and thus break it apart and create a distance between us and the world through the use of language and discursive thought.\n\nExcuse the ramble, this is just one of my key areas of interest ATM! To more directly address your point - You can be empathetic and still overthink; it just means you see problems to be solved in the world around you more than relations to be entered into and lived - we (myself included) tend to rely on rational solutions to what are often irrational situations. It is a state of being we are conditioned into through our particular use of language and cultural modes of thought (scientific instrumentalism). An alternative would be to see ourselves as an integral part of a larger whole, a part which can be tuned to be in greater harmony with that whole (vs having problems to be finally fixed), rather than seeing ourselves as a separate and distinct entity which can break things down and put them back together better - an inherently objectifying and instrumentalist perspective.", "id": "dxlo4qg", "parent_id": "t1_dxkjhz4"}, {"body": "You don't want to be me...it sounds better than it is...I'm not sure I want to be me. - Elon Musk\n\nhttps://youtu.be/A9GKeYb_vkQ", "id": "dxpssi0", "parent_id": "t1_dxp6guq"}, {"body": "Would really suggest you don't miss it, the last few parts are the most informative!", "id": "dwrw6cl", "parent_id": "t1_dwrqc3e"}, {"body": "Christ, how many edgy buzzwords can one cram into one link.", "id": "dxe6a46", "parent_id": "t1_dxe4r2v"}, {"body": "This is a fantastic article, and I've referenced it several times in researching my latest video!

Here are some of my thoughts...\n\nAt first glance, I have to wonder if causing offense is, in and of itself, morally blameworthy at all.\n\nOffense is an emotional response - little different from anger or grief or happiness or fear, as far as that goes.  As such, it seems that its mere existence isn't morally relevant at all - rather, its existence is, at least potentially, an indicator of something else that is morally relevant.\n\nIf I kill your dog and cause you grief, I'm not morally blameworthy because I caused you grief.  That's not the point - really, significant though the experience of the emotion might be, it's incidental.  Quite obviously, the act that's morally relevant is killing your dog, and your grief is just an emotional response to that act.\n\nBut that's not satisfying by itself, because offense is something different from other emotional responses.  In a way, it's both something less and something more.\n\nIt's something less in that it's often a response to something that's not morally relevant in and of itself.  When you feel grief because I killed your dog, there's the clearly morally relevant act of killing your dog at the heart of it, but if you feel offense because I'm wearing a t-shirt with a word on it that offends you, there's really not a morally relevant act at the heart of that.  My t-shirt does no actual, measurable harm to you or to anyone - ALL it's done is triggered an emotional response in you.  That emotional response isn't indicative of something else - it stands alone.  And at some fundamental level, it's just not my problem.  If you don't want to be subject to some particular emotion, then stop cultivating it.\n\nBut at the same time, in another sense, the fact that offense is a bit different from most emotions in that it can be and often is triggered by something that in and of itself is morally irrelevant makes offense something more than other emotions, at least as far as this topic goes.  The thing is that that aspect of offense makes it possible, as you note, for people to act in a particular manner specifically because they know that that will cause offense in someone else, and that specifically because they want that other person or people to have the negative experience of feeling offense.  And that would seem to be a morally blameworthy act.\n\nI tend to think though that that's the only way in which acting in a manner that causes offense is morally blameworthy.  I don't think a case can be made that doing so in ignorance is morally blameworthy, except insofar as one might attempt to make a case that ignorance is in and of itself morally blameworthy, since a person cannot rightly be faulted for doing that which they sincerely do not know to be in any possible way wrong.\n\nAnd even in cases in which one acts in a manner that's destined to cause offense, I still don't believe that it's morally blameworthy unless and until it's done specifically in order to cause offense - or more simply, to make the point better, specifically in order to cause another person to have an unpleasant experience.\n\nIn fact, I tend to think that if a person acts in a way that they know will cause offense but they do so because they believe that their action is morally right, then in some sense, the whole matter shifts.  Then the other party's offense becomes irrelevant *at best*, and it could be argued that the offense is at least edging toward, or indicative of, some moral wrong on the part of the offended party.  At the very least, the offended party then MUST make the case not only that the offending party knew that the act would be seen to be offensive, but that the act is morally wrong in and of itself.  Even the fact that it could be known to be offensive isn't sufficient by itself.\n\nFor instance, I'm certain that a great many people were deeply offended when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on the bus.  I'm just as certain though that virtually all people, most notably including those otherwise most eager to make the case that causing offense is morally blameworthy in and of itself, would argue that she was right to act as she did, in spite of the certainty that it would cause offense, or the fact that it did.  \n\nAnd in fact, I would be willing to bet that most people, and again most notably including many of those otherwise most eager to try to make the case that causing offense is morally blameworthy in and of itself, would, if they were to assign a moral value to the offense caused by her refusal to give up her seat, hold that the person who *felt* the offense - not the person who caused it - was morally wrong.  \n\nAll in all, an intriguingly complicated issue...\n\nI think your conclusion is solid, though I would've likely approached it from a somewhat different angle (as the above likely indicates).  In the long run, I come to roughly the same conclusion - before one attempts to make the case that the fact that one is offended means that one has been wronged, one must first make the case that the offense was intentional, and even more to the point, that it was maliciously intended - not merely that it was known that this action would cause offense, but that causing offense was the exact point.\n\nThere's another aspect to this whole matter though, but while it is, I believe, central to the fact that offense has come to be such a meaningful thing to so many in the current age, it's only peripherally significant to this particular matter.  That's the fact that, for many, offense is actually sought out and cultivated - not merely tolerated, but indulged in - and that specifically because of the role it plays in self-affirmation.  I prove that I'm a virtuous person (by whatever standard) by signaling my offense at (whatever that standard defines as offensive).\n\nBut that's likely fodder for another post (or three), and I think that so long as a distinction is made between acts that are committed with malicious intent to cause offense and acts that are not, it's not particularly relevant.\n\nAnd thanks for the thoughtful and well-argued post.

AI is hot and I think it will continue to play a large role in the future. Because of this, I could imagine competition getting more fierce in the future, but at least currently there is a high demand for people with AI (and especially ML) backgrounds. Possible cons are that there is a lot of uninformed discussion in and about the field, and politics are getting more and more prominent (but these things may be true for many other fields as well). Within AI there are more and less popular subfields though: ML (especially with deep neural networks) is super hot, but e.g. expert systems have fallen out of favor a bit (although one professor told me this is basically because they're solved so there's not much to research, but they're still pretty useful).\n\nRegarding the body of your post: as you can see from the other responses, a con of being an A*G*I researcher is currently that AI/ML researchers will deny your / your research's existence. The [AGI Society](http://www.agi-society.org/) is quite small and most AI/ML researchers either don't know about it or don't hold it in high regard. I should be clear that nobody in the AGI Society has (seemingly) figured it all out, and since we don't make incremental improvements on specialized benchmarks, we have very little to show for our work from the perspective of researchers who basically live for that. My experience has been that this can also make it very difficult to actually do research, because AGI people can be a little overly ambitious, there's not that much to build on (at least in my case), and it's not acceptable to merely improve something a little bit. I also don't think my career options are nearly as good as someone with a PhD in machine learning. The obvious pro is that I get to actually (try to) work on AGI, which I consider to be the most interesting thing in the world.\n\nOf course, today there *is* a more fashionable branch of research that ostensibly aims at AGI. Companies like Google DeepMind, Facebook (AI Research) and OpenAI now openly say they are working on solving intelligence. We've had workshops on Deep Learning and AGI at the yearly [AGI conference](http://agi-conference.org/2018/), and while I think deep learning is a bit overhyped in this regard, I can't deny that I find the progress interesting (especially in combination with reinforcement learning and search).

This can be habitual and doesn't necessarily correlate with a conscious desire/decision to use others selfishly, it's more that rational thinking is tied into analysis, categorisation and objectification of the Other and not an organic, lived and non-reflexive/non-discursive relationship with it. \n\nThinking generally produces a distance between subject/object (real or otherwise) which is useful but can become pathological when relied on excessively. This comes from my personal experience and the observation of hyper-rational people who tend to discount irrational things like empathy, compassion and connection in favour of utilitarian or otherwise instrumental, cold-calculation value-judgements.\n\nIn other words, hyper-rationality, by overvaluing discursive thought, overlays a field of conceptualisation upon experience, causing us to see the world as a logic puzzle to be definitively solved, and others encountered as pieces to be moved and manipulated in search of this goal, rather than seeing the Other as something inherently ungraspable, ultimately indefinable in its totality and yet something we can enter into meaningful relationship with. \n\nThis overreliance on rationality is essentially based on fear, as it is easier to deal with something if we break it down into rationally digestible pieces rather than encounter ourselves and other beings in their wholeness, as something which our discursive minds cannot pin down and thus recoils from in horror - we are overwhelmed by the reality of existence and thus break it apart and create a distance between us and the world through the use of language and discursive thought.\n\nExcuse the ramble, this is just one of my key areas of interest ATM!

Tattoos are lowest form of expression, and people who have them are borderline criminals. Buildings should be held at same standards. \n\nSo modernism in Architecture was born! Clean, precise lines where form serves the function. Structure can be exposed for all its beauty and does not need to hide behind mindless ornament. But, it turns out objective rationalism is really boring means of expression. \n\nNext generation of architects introduced post modernism. Take modernism and make it subjectively beautiful. You are still using the modern palette of building materials and systems, but now you can also uniquely express your own design ideas that often do not introduce utility or purpose. This shift favors those who want to be considered artists and master builders again. Hard criticism of your work can be dismissed as difference in tastes. \n\nPerhaps this ties into post modern politics as well. It is not necessary to be objectively correct.

I'm currently a student at Oxford and a lot of my studies are focused on logic as it relates to philosophy; I've had tutorials with a couple of the logicians linked above. There have been plenty of significant contributions to philosophical logic in the past fifty years or so, e.g. Kripke's modal logic, or Dummett's revival of Frege and Hale and Wright's [Neo-Logicism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logicism/#SecOrdLogHumPri), just to name a couple off the top of my head. It's also not true that technical applications of logic have dried up, especially in set theory, as a couple of the examples that /u/completely-ineffable mentioned show. Logic also still plays a crucial role in [various theories in the philosophy of maths](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mathematics). A good example is the formal proof-theoretic predicativism developed by Feferman and Wang; intuitionism and nominalism are a couple of other prominent theories of maths that the philosophy of logic is very important to, as is set-theoretic structuralism.\n\n&gt; You look at modern philosophers and modern philosophy and they've all sort of thrown logic under the bus. They prefer semantics. Discussions of what words mean and how they can be used to espouse a statement of fact.\n\nIt is true that a lot of the study of semantics is in the field of linguistics and does not really relate to logic. But Discussions of what words mean and how they can be used to espouse a statement of fact is exactly the issue that Russell was concerned with 'On Denoting' when he discussed the King of France example. The study of those kinds of issues continues today, e.g. with [two-dimensional semantics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/two-dimensional-semantics/), in a manner that is just as related to logic as it was back then. \n\nI just don't see how you can talk about 'philosophers' as if they're some single hivemind that has collectively shifted away from logic; maybe I should let my tutors know that philosophy and the post-Russell community have simply moved on.

The state always has to have laws in place that determine who owns property, and whether the only way to get a stake in some property is contractual or whether there can be other ways. For example, who owns a house? Is it just the person whose name is on the deeds? Or does someone who contributes financially to the house, perhaps by paying some of the mortgage, thereby get a stake? Do you become entitled to a stake in some property if you contribute to it with unpaid labour, such as caring or domestic work? \n\nIn my book I don't give answers to specific policy questions such as these. We will all have different views and settling these questions would take many more books!

Young scholars are running themselves into the ground to survive long enough to even think about a full research position, and plenty of them are deciding to look elsewhere.\n\nThe same goes for those in established research positions in terms of workload, but whilst they're being paid for their research (as much as ever) they're being loaded up with ever increasing admin roles. It's all well and good, and the institution has to keep the lights on of course, but this is all time taken away from teaching, research and dissemination - and it's all done in the same 'good faith' arrangement. Academics are understood to love Universities, and as a result the University sees that we have a vested interest in going above and beyond to keep things ticking over. The other side of this, of course, is that those admin jobs are generally part of streamlining efforts - which means that dedicated administration and support departments are being gutted, with the workload being shunted towards research staff.\n\nGenerally, the sector is under pressure to prove itself in myriad ways, and that filters through as pressure applied directly to an already overworked staff. We're spending almost as long demonstrating the worth of our work as we are doing the damn thing in the first place. A lot of those pressures are coming from government intervention, with the current government seeming intent on promoting a narrative which suggests that academics are living a cushy life, charging student's enormous fees and generally not giving 'value for money'. Ho hum.\n\nMore recently, we've had huge national strikes by university staff  - predominantly from the research side through one of our employee unions over pensions disputes. The details are outside of my expertise, but our existing pension arrangement is being torn up in the name of better value for money for the student - whatever that means, and reduced costs everywhere. It's all a hot mess, it's creating a fraught relationship between staff and 'management', and that good will I mentioned above - that the university so relies on at the moment - is being hugely eroded. A lot of people were reasonably happy to go the extra mile for the university in the past, because they're right when they assume that we do love the place(s), but now the tacit appreciation of that effort, the restriction of our ability to do good research in the name of proving value, and an apparent dedication to gutting our salaries and pensions is leading people to lose faith in the academy and look elsewhere.", "id": "dxgj71q", "parent_id": "t1_dxggkf2"}, {"body": "Also, it is problematic to act like specifically Islam is responsible for all of the problems inherent in Islamic countries. Really many of the problems (violence, misogyny, homophobia, etc.) are ubiquitous in many countries. Cambodians killed 4,000,000 of their countrymen under an atheistic regime in the 70s (and Cambodia was a mostly Buddhist population prior to that). Russia routinely kills dissidents and starts war in foreign countries. Mexico is a Catholic nation, yet 30k people were murdered there in gang warfare just last year. In fact, [take a look at the 30 countries with the highest murder rates in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate), you will find a lack of Muslim majority nations, and mostly Catholic/Christian ones. The most oppressive country in the world is North Korea. Russia, Uganda, Paraguay, and China have all recently passed homophobic laws.  Islam is responsible for some amount of homophobia, misogyny and violence in its country, but none of these things are unique to Islamic countries.          \n          \nIt also fails to acknowledge the role actions from Western countries have had in the formation of Radical Islam. Radical Islam came about during the 60s primarily as a way to fight against Western intervention in Muslim countries. Strict Muslim adherents made for passionate fighters willing to die for their cause. Conservative Islam in Iran proved very effective in removing the British imposed Shah from power. Conservative fighters helped rid Afghanistan of Russian control in the 80s. ISIS formed from the former commanders of Sadame's regime and was helped by the instability created by the West in Syria and Libya. End of the day, the second Gulf War had a casualty total of 500,000 civilians, including thousands of dead civilians directly from US soldiers and bombing campaigns. We are seeing now though, that during times of relative piece, conservatives are losing their stranglehold in the Middle East. Iran has started to see liberalization, Saudi Arabia has passed some liberal reforms (though obviously it still has ways to go). With ISIS mostly defeated, there have been far fewer attacks in its name recently. We just need to not help create another ISIS.           \n       \nAdditionally, a large majority of anti Western sentiment among Islamic nations is due to the ongoing support of Israel. Blame whoever you want for the current animosity between Palestinians and Israelis, but you still have to acknowledge that a bunch of European governments forcefully removing hundreds of thousands of native Palestinians from their homeland as repayment for a European country killing 6 million Jews was outrageous. What did the Palestinians do to deserve that fate?            \n        \nFinally, it is important to acknowledge difference in the spread of Islam in different places. In the US, for example, over the past 20 years less than 200 people have been killed by domestic Islamic Extremism (9/11 was not a domestic operation). Worrying about the spread of radical Islam in the US makes very little sense. In Europe, due to its close position to North Africa and Turkey, they certainly have more reason to be worried. But many of the rights problems with Muslims, is more economics based (tons of the British were happy to eject the migrant Poles from their country). Saying that all the problems with crime and poverty that Muslim immigrants bring is because they are Muslim, and not that they are poor is disingenuous. Even in the Middle East and South Asia, many of the conservative fighters are part of the movement for economic reasons. In the hills of Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda is one of the few employers and it allows you to earn a fair wage. ISIS also paid its soldiers a decent salary. When there are no other opportunities, people will join whoever offers them the ability to survive. Look to Germany in the 1930s to see this in action.        \n        \n**tl;dr:** Any attempt to single out Islam as singularly violent or ideologically backwards and refuses to acknowledge the impact the Western world has played in the growth of conservative/radical Islam most likely is either ignorant of the history of the movement, or deliberately promoting an anti-Islamic agenda.

They have a disease.\u201d But that disease is based on a societal norm of what a sound mind is. We all have predispositions.

A rock has no mind, no feelings, no intentions.  We do not consider a rock morally culpable during a landslide that kills a person (we aren't going to send a rock to prison or condemn it to hell) and in general we do not give a generic rock's wellbeing any consideration in questions of ethics and morality (with rare exception for those rock formations that *humans* value).  \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum we have humans.  Humans have minds, intelligence, sentience, sapience, agency, etc., whatever you want to call it.  So we do consider humans moral agents and we do consider them and their outcomes in ethical and moral questions.  If a human causes a landslide's damage they are culpable, and if we must break a few humans to do a thing we do give their negative outcomes moral and ethical weight in a way we would not for a generic rock. \n\nI believe and would argue the reason we give weight to the outcomes of humans instead of rocks in moral and ethical questions ultimately boils down to their agency, intellect, sapience, mind, etc., or some combination of the former.  \n\nSo what about animals?

Throwing heads on every odd throw and tails on every even also has a probability of about 2e-28.\n\nThe thing is, human beings do not classify the outcome of 92 throws into 5e27 categories. We classify it into maybe a handful of categories. One possible classification scheme is: about 50/50 | more heads than tails (~70/30) | less heads than tails (~30/70) | all throws come up one side.\n\nIn this scenario, getting 92 heads is legitimately **astronomically** more surprising than getting about 50/50.\n\nThe author discusses this on pages 4 and 5 in a slightly different way, but for me thinking about it in categories makes it more clear that we *should* be surprised at a run of all heads. We aren't comparing one exact prediction to another, we're comparing one category of result to another.\n\n&gt;We shouldn't believe the sequences [at the ends of the bellcurve] won't come up, while keeping an open mind about the sequences [near the center of the bell curve]. There are no grounds for this -- the sequences are all on par.\n\n I do not think that the author has sufficiently justified this point. The bell curve shows exactly the opposite, that an outcome near 50/50 is *not* on par with an outcome of all heads. Of course, you can't 100% discount the all heads outcome. But the entire point of probabilities is that you can 99.9% discount it.\n\n&gt;In fact we could pick *any* set of 3,700 trillion sequences, on whatever basis we like, and it will be approx. 73.8% probable that the actual sequence will be one in the set\n\nThis is a much more interesting argument, and the reason I wanted to talk about things in terms of human-centric categorizations. It is, of course, true. But I don't think that it proves the point the author wants it to. If there is something significant to you about the partition of sequences predicated on having at least two heads or two tails in a row (ie all sequences except HTHTHTHT... and THTHTHTH...), then it absolutely should be surprising to you if one of those two throws are made on the first try. It is perfectly logical to assume that a more likely event (not getting one of those two throws) will happen over a less likely event.\n\n&gt;Whatever the truth, it can't just so happen that the car is gone now and there is nothing more to the story\n\nYes, it absolutely can just so happen. An unbelievable amount of electrons in the car could have tunneled in such a way that a critical amount of the structural bonds in the car broke, turning it into dust that was carried away on the wind. A 5th dimensional wormhole could have sucked it into the other side of the universe. I don't mean to say that either is literally possible, just that such phenomena may exist. But if they do, they are so extremely *unlikely* that one would be irrational to believe that they had happened. So instead you look for the *more likely* explanation. \n\nMy point is that any event that demands explanation does so because the current explanations seem too unlikely, and you hope for a more likely one. And so we are back to probability underlying (rational) surprise. Of course, a bad understanding of probability can lead you to surprise at a likely event, in which case an explanation of the actual statistics can satisfy that surprise. So maybe explanations having something to do with surprise in that way.\n\nIDK, I didn't have strong opinions on this topic this morning, I'm probably just reflexively playing devils advocate.

Some of them are general and some of them are specific. Let me try and answer some of them.\n\nMarriage is generally much more common for white Americans than for black Americans. Katharine Franke has a fantastic book on this issue - it's called Wedlocked - and I use it at various points in my book Against Marriage. As you say, mass incarceration is part of the reason for the difference in marriage patterns between white and black Americans, as is the legacy of slavery. But I argue that these differences strengthen my critique of marriage. A focus on marriage as the paradigmatic stable family form is racist in that it casts the dominant family form for white Americans as the dominant family form for all, even though it is not in fact the paradigmatic stable family form for all. Similar concerns arise with class. A focus on marriage as the paradigm contributes to the stigma of the single mother, particularly the poor single mother.\n\nAs for the choice paradigm: in my work, particularly my book Sex, Culture, and Justice, I critique a focus on choice. I absolutely agree, and argue in that book, that a focus on choice obscures culture and social context.\n\nAs for intersectionality in general, and the question of perspective, we all have a perspective, and we are all necessarily more familiar with our own perspective than with anyone else's. I am white and middle-class, and so are many philosophers. But my work does engage directly with the assumptions of liberalism, and with the importance of recognising and critiquing those assumptions, with respect to sex, class, race, culture and context in general. I don't claim to be able to escape my own particular subject-position. No-one can. (I also certainly don't claim to know what is good for all British people, let alone all Americans!)

I don't see how that is anything other than a distinction without a difference.\n\n\nYour point seems to be correct; she's outlining some type of goal. Perhaps with the intent to compare that to what the apparent  goal of the status quo is. Since any goals are essentially the product of a hierarchy of values, her goal would only be new/different if it's based on different values from the status quo. \n\n\nHer stated values seem to be something like egalitarian rights, uncoerced freedom of choice, and protection of the vulnerable. If I've got those halfway right, it's just not clear to me how modern western manifestations of marriage aren't in line with that. One, I think reasonable, interpretation of the value/goal of marriage would be the pooling of resources and responsibilities between two consenting adults for the purpose ensuring adequate care for the vulnerable offspring (or at least each other). \n\nCurrent incarnations of the legal milieu surrounding marriage already account for post-separation support for the non-breadwinner/caregiver including ownership of domiciles and provisioning for the children. If her stated aim is the abolition of this institution, does that imply her values run counter to the implied values of the current system? Are children not the most vulnerable members of a family? \n\nI could probably go on, but my point is that if the value of marriage is to strengthen a family by legal ties and shared property, what goal/values is Ms Chambers advocating?

It's clickbait all the way down!\n\nSo I actually went through and read the essay, for whatever reason. It's, as /u/xatham said, largely drivel. The first seven or so pages are dedicated to promoting the problems of racism and whiteness. It's a standard paper on racism, not a critique on education until this point. After that it briefly tries to claim that science isn't the only way of knowing and we should consider multicultural viewpoints...without discussing what those viewpoints are. It's an inflammatory racism hit piece, nothing more. Here are some choice quotes:\n\n&gt;Therefore, education, including science education, must invest in learning about and recognizing this racial pain in order to combat racism. However, if our goal in science education is to liberate our students of Color from an oppressive system that encapsulates western science discourses, CRT is only one component of understanding how white supremacy operates.\n\nThe goal of science education is nothing of the sort. It's to teach science. If you're approaching it from the standpoint of liberating students of color, they're going to come out of your class with no understanding of science. Congrats!\n\n&gt;As such, Western science was perceived as correct and universal and was forcibly adopted by other countries and cultures during European exploration and colonization. Ann Ryan (2008) argues that the history of European colonization and conquest influenced contemporary attitudes of valid knowledge, and much of the way western nations teach science erases the values and culture of indigenous people. Therefore, our science is out of touch with the experiences of our students of Color and, instead, represent post-colonial discourses of White power and control over people of Color via forcing the internalization of Western science knowledge (Ryan 2008).\n\nI mean...yeah. If you can come to me and demonstrate that your cultural traditions are a viable way of interpreting and describing the world, we can discuss incorporating them into the broader scientific context. Until then...it's not science, and shouldn't be taught as such.\n\n&gt;Our current discourse believes that science and how we approach experimentation and constructing scientific explanations is unbiased, and on the surface, it may seem justified (Kelly 2014). However, this way of knowing science in the absence of other ways of knowing only furthers whiteness and White supremacy through power and control of science knowledge. As a result, our students of Color are victims of deculturization, and their own worldviews are invalidated, such as described by Ladson-Billings (1998a).\n\nOh boy, it continues. It looks like the authors are trying to make epistemological claims wrapped up in race. If you've got arguments for why these multicultural ways of thinking should be considered, please, make them. Otherwise it's worthless to just say, Hey, *maybe* there's validity in not thinking in a scientific context!\n\nYeah, science education is pretty Western-dominated...because that's what's worked. What types of ways of knowing do cultures of color offer us? How valuable are they? How do they compare to traditional science education?

In short, how can psychology or neuroscience ever be successful if it is founded on this flawed theory of mind replete with unjustifiable assumptions?

And it is only then, after it has happened, that the beneficiaries, the epicures of post-history, will know what history was made of.\n\nI frankly don't give a fuck how it all turns out in this country -- or anywhere else, for that matter. I think the human game was up a long time ago (when the high priests and traders took over), and now we're just playing out the string.

The government at the time commissioned a work-group to figure out how the newly discovered oil could best benefit the country and it's people, in both the short and long term. To solve that challenge they actually hired skilled academic philosophers, and they advised a model where Norway and it's people got full control over the resources and where the wealth were used to pay for a welfare state.\n\nAnother example is that today that wealth is invested in the global financial markets. Around 1% of the stocks in the world are owned by Norway. They use philosophers such as Henrik Syse to help decide how to best invest the wealth, i.e. invest in ways that mitigates harm to the planet and to people etc.\n\nOther examples are contemporary Philosophy of law and Political philosophy which have effects not just in the present but will also have effects in the future, though it can be hard to quantify these effects.

Many people in our society would chalk up his uncharacteristic\nbehaviors to a \u201cmidlife crisis,\u201d a period of dramatic self-questioning and turbulence in middle age (40 to 60 years old), as one confronts mortality, physical decline,\nand unful filled hopes and dreams.\nThe idea that many people experience a difficult life transition when poised roughly midway between birth and death isn\u2019t of recent vintage. In the 14th century,\nthe first lines of Alighieri Dante\u2019s (1265\u20131321) epic poem the Divine Comedy evoked the idea of a midlife crisis:\nMidway upon the journey of our life I found\nmyself within a forest dark,\nFor the straightforward pathway had been lost.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until 1965 that Elliott Jacques coined the term \u201cmidlife crisis\u201d to describe the compulsive attempts to remain young and defy the reality of death that he\nobserved in middle-aged artists and composers. Jacque served up this catchy phrase for the public and scientific commun ity to describe virtually any unsettling life\ntransition people experience in middle age. A decade later, Gail Sheehy\u2019s (1976) bestselling book, Passages: Predictable Crises of Adult Life, cemented the idea of\na mid-life crisis in the public imagination. By 1994, 86% of young adults sur veyed believed in the reality of a \u201cmidlife crisis\u201d (Lachman, Lewkowicz, Marcus, &amp;\nPeng, 1994).\nThe film industry has pounced all over the idea of a turbulent period in midlife by depicting goofy and screwed up, yet likeable, middle aged guys\u2014the\nprotagonists are mostly male\u2014who question the meaning and value of their lives. In City Slickers (1991), three men (played by Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, and\nBruno Kirby), all experiencing a midlife crisis, take a 2-week break from their humdrum lives to go on a cattle drive from New Mexico to Colorado. A more recent\nriff on the same theme, the movie Wild Hogs (2007), portrays the adventures of four middle-aged men who hit the road on motorcycles to rekindle the excitement of\ntheir youth. No movie captures the supposed rut of middle age better than Groundhog Day (1993), in which comedian Bill Murray portrays Phil Connors, a heavy\ndrinking, self-absorbed weatherman, who\u2019s fated to repeat the same day, every day, until he finally \u201cgets\u201d that his life can have meaning when he becomes a better\nperson. In Bull Durham (1988), Kevin Costner portrays baseball player \u201cCrash\u201d Davis, exiled to the minor leagues to coach a talented young player. Crash is\nkeenly aware of his youth sliding away, much like his waning ability to slide safely into home plate, but he eventually finds love and fulfillment with baseball\ngroupie Annie Savoy (played by Susan Sarandon). In the Academy Award-winning movie, American Beauty (1999), Lester Burnham (played by Kevin Spacey)\ndisplays all of the stereotypic hall marks of a male midlife crisis. He quits his high pressure job to work as a burger turner, starts to use drugs and works out, buys a\nsports car, and becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter\u2019s girlfriend.\nThe Internet and books provide advice to help people negotiate not only their midlife crisis but their spouse\u2019s crisis as well. That\u2019s right: Women aren\u2019t immune to\nmidlife angst either. The Internet site for the Midlife Club (http://midlifeclub.com/) warns its visitors that: \u201cWhether it\u2019s your midlife crisis, or the midlife crisis of\nsomeone you love, whether you\u2019re a man or a woman\u2014you\u2019re in for a bumpy ride!\u201d The club peddles books in which men and women who \u201cmade it through the\ncrisis\u201d share their wisdom, strategies, and stories with one another.

He\ndiscovered that editors used the term \u201cmidlife crisis\u201d an average of twice a month to headline reviews of books, films, and tele vision programs.\nIn addition to Internet and media coverage, another reason why the notion of a midlife crisis may persist is that it\u2019s based on a shard of truth. Psychologist Erik\nErikson (1968) observed that in middle adult hood, most people grapple with finding direction, meaning, and purpose in their lives, and they strive to find out\nwhether there\u2019s a need for a mid-course correction. We\u2019ll see that Erikson exaggerated the prevalence of a crisis in middle age, but he was right that some people\nexperience marked self-doubt in the intermediate years of life. Yet people reevalu-ate their goals and priorities and experience crises in every decade of life, as\nevidenced by the emotional tumult some (but by no means all; see Myth #7) teens experience. Moreover, the experiences that fall under the umbrella of the \u201cmidlife\ncrisis\u201d are very broad\u2014such as change of job, divorce, buying a sports car\u2014and nebulous. As a consequence, one could consider most any upheaval or life change\nproof positive of a midlife meltdown.\nSome \u201csymptoms\u201d of a midlife crisis, such as divorce, are actually more likely to occur prior to middle age. In the United States, people first divorce, on average,\nwithin 5 years of marriage, at age 33 for men and 31 for women (Clarke, 1995). Moreover, when people purchase their fantasy sports car in their 40s, it may have\nnothing to do with making the best of a crisis. Rather, they may finally be able to make the payments on the car for which they longed as teenagers.\nStudies across cultures provide no fodder for the idea that middle age is a particularly stressful and difficult period. In a study of 1,501 Chinese married adults\nbetween 30 and 60 years old, Daniel Shek (1996) failed to find high levels of dissatisfaction approaching a \u201ccrisis\u201d in the majority of middle-aged men and women.\nResearchers funded by The Mac Arthur Foundation studied a total of nearly 7,195 men and women aged 25 to 74, of whom 3,032 were interviewed in the largest\nstudy of people at midlife (Brim, Ryff, &amp; Kessler, 2004). Contrary to the popular stereotype, people in the 40 to 60 age range generally felt more in control of their\nlives and expressed greater feelings of well-being compared with the previous decade of their lives. In addition, more than three quarters of respondents rated their\nrelationships as good to excellent. Men and women were equally likely to experience what they considered to be a midlife crisis. The researchers found that\nconcerns about having a midlife crisis were more common than actually experiencing a crisis. \n\n&gt; Several other findings debunk the myth of the midlife crisis. Across studies, only 10\u201326% (depending on how scientists define the midlife crisis) of people report\nthey\u2019ve experienced a midlife crisis (Brim, 1992; Wethington, 2000). In addition, middle age can be a period of peak psy chological functioning (Lachman, 2003).\nClearly, a midlife crisis isn\u2019t a prospect for everyone, or even a likely occurrence. So if you want to make radical changes in your life, and buy a red sports car or a\n\u201cwild hog\u201d motorcycle, it\u2019s never too early\u2014and never too late\u2014to do so.\n\nExcerpt taken from this book:\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6836438-50-great-myths-of-popular-psychology\n", "id": "dxp80e2", "parent_id": "t3_8do2jf"}, {"body": "i think because he learnt a different language while still a teen, his english accent wasn\u2019t as set in stone, and he was able to accommodate the different styles of speaking", "id": "dwt5y2i", "parent_id": "t1_dwszhdq"}, {"body": "Great series.

Some languages have a sharp distinction between past, present, and future, and others are more nebulous and don't necessarily specify the time. Supposedly, by removing the temporal component in the language, people are conditioned to see the future self as the same as present self, which means saving now to help your future self is the same as helping your present self. In languages that make the distinction, you have more people saying ehhh...future me can deal with it because hurting future you is different than hurting present you.

In a manorial-based economy there is no breadwinner at all, there is just a village and an agrarian commons, which is the main productive unit.

Access to the commons gave women more social power within the village and the household than they had under early-modern capitalism, even in spite of things like sexist inheritance laws and religious beliefs.\n\nThe rise of factories, wage labor, etc., changed everything. The commons was enclosed and privatized away, and everyone moved into the cities.

So, according to this internal logic, if you can qualify a fetus as a person then you have automatically bestowed rights to it. That would mean that taking its life qualifies as murder.\n\nLooking more towards your example there, there are some things to take notice of. When you say, woman's right to bodily autonomy then there are a few things to consider. Firstly, where does this right come from. As we know, rights come from all kinds of places--depending on the authority, that authority may or may not be contestable; this also applies to the pro-life arguments but the same diligence should be taken in questioning authority because you manage to dismantle the wrong authority, you will find that all other things that authority gave out as rights to us are also in jeopardy. Secondly, why is autonomy constricted to the body? What about autonomy in general. Do we arrive at problems when we decide that autonomy extended to other areas of a woman produce unexpected consequences. For instance, if the woman is assaulting someone then does she revoke her right to autonomy and allow a physician to administer chemical restraints. \n\nNot to dwell too long on the left side, but turning towards the right: There are the classic questions of just what exactly is a person. It is an abstraction that was created but one with enormous consequences. If you strip another human's person-hood then you will have free reign to enslave or genocide them. Here, too, there is an issue of authority because some people think that person-hood is decided by god, etc. Another complication is the area of psychology because we seem to bestow and revoke person-hood on an individual basis. For example, some people do not see cats and dogs as persons but others do; that disagreement holds great sway over the behavior of people and how they treat animals. If you look at someone talk to their dog like it is a person, it may just be because they actually think it is one beyond their own intentions. It seems that a person is the conceptualization of something occurring beneath the level of awareness. Things get muddied when you suddenly realize that like cats and dogs, some humans see a fetus as a person and some do not-psychologically. This is another tricky area. \n\nYour confusion about rights is not unmerited: rights are completely abstract creations with each one coming out of a system of its own internal logic. It does not seem that there will ever be any such thing as an absolute right that transcends all perspectives. Instead, it will always be mired in the murky pool of human subjectivity. If there were ever a victor in the battle of abortion then it more signifies a change in power distribution in society or elected officials than it does an argument being proven right.

So we can't expect everyone to behave as though it is because they won't believe it.\n\nSo if it's inevitable then we could probably adopt utilitarianism as a decent approach for the next ... What's the timeframe ? 50 years to Armageddon is quite different from 500.\n\n\nAnd if it's not inevitable? Then WD should work to solve the problems using the resources we each have, with particular public attention paid to those who hold positions of power responsible for such matters.\n\nIf indeed it can be changed, all three of your proposed responses to the inevitable may in fact hasten its arrival if it could in reality be avoided.\n\nSo overall, inevitable or not, because we can't know or prove that it is, we must therefore take the optimistic path and believe that we can change reality and we can work together to accomplish goals.  These claims are widely believed and I can prove them, so it's a more reasonable response to attempt to resolve all of these problems.\n\nAlso, if it is inevitable, what would be lose by trying?\n", "id": "dxf8jvl", "parent_id": "t3_8ci2xl"}, {"body": "/r/samplesize", "id": "dxj03zd", "parent_id": "t3_8cz4uk"}, {"body": "Death and life are inexorably linked, and as such difficult to state that neither are a part of one another. \n\nHumans are consciously aware of their own mortality, viewed in a variety of our cultures across time.

The argument generally boils down to At what point in development should a human fetus be considered a person?. You appear to be arguing that personhood requires consciousness, which is contrary to the pro-life position. That's a disagreement, not a fallacy. Also, I would avoid using examples of plants and computers for this subject because neither of them are human and for most people the concepts of murder and personhood only apply to humans.\n\nTo me it makes sense that from a *legal* standpoint the period of life before birth should have different rules than life after birth. Miscarriages are unfortunately common and it would not be practical or beneficial to treat those as you would the death of an adult or child. However, from a *moral* standpoint it seems to me that the distinction of when personhood begins is more or less arbitrary. Usually the rationale is tied to a biological event or capability: Conception, brain development, or as someone mentioned in another comment, homeostasis. \n\nIn order to have a productive argument about which of these points is **the** critical point at which a human becomes a person, you first need to have agreement about the definition of terms, which is hard to do with terms such as person, life, or consciousness. If you find someone with whom you agree on the precise definition of those terms, you've probably found someone who already shares your views on abortion.\n\nMy personal view is that both life and moral personhood begin at (or very close to) conception, because that is the first point at which the fetus becomes a biologically distinct entity. It is neither part of the mother's body nor part of the father's body. It is also meaningfully different from an individual egg or sperm cell because (with the necessary biological support) it will grow. The thing it grows into is considered a person, and I do not see good reason for this personhood to come from any of the development milestones along the way (such as the attainment of consciousness).\n\nThat's my position, but there could be any number of logically valid competing ones. Unfortunately this is a subject on which it is hard to agree to disagree, because legal policies are being driven by this debate and justice is at stake.

The ending of a future takes away and possibility of improvement.  It's like cashing in when the stock market is down.  No one knows what the future holds, but as long as there is  a future there are infinite possibilities.  As horrible as life becomes there remains a possibility of improvement if a future exists.\n\n2.) I don't really understand this weight out on an empty planet being good.  An empty planet is an empty planet.  Who looks at Jupiter and says that's good beyond the interest of there being a planet.  No animal thinks Jupiter is good.  Furthermore we could do anything we want to earth there will still be an earth.  We could try to eradicate every living organism on this planet and it will still remain. \n\n3.) This point to end suffering is a little vague to me as well. Suffering is subjective and its value is dependent on the moment.  I suffer when I run. But I enjoy it because I have a net gain and I feel better later.  If suffering truly became so great no one could stand it then we can always kill ourselves.  Since the majority of people want to live one can assume they have value on their life and so it is a net positive existence. Same can be said for animals.  Suffering can be both bad and good.\n\nOverall I vote for continuing the human race.

When I look out at the world, I cannot help but draw the conclusion that it's wrong to execute an innocent person unjustly; it's a matter of conscience. So, too, many religious beliefs are constructed in a similar way. People look out at the world and cannot help but believe that God exists, or read scripture and cannot help but believe it has a particular reading. To choose to deliberately violate one's conscience and one's God has arguably some of the same psychological damage as trying to change one's sexual orientation.\n\nThis also feels like an unnecessary argument because I know of very few people who believe religious identities aren't immune to criticism, especially when it comes to matters of ethics that the Left treats as morally laudatory.
